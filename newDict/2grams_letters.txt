the latter
was an
mess that
to be
logic and
hit it
it off
off in
with the
in the
the end
well it's
deja vu
good will
will hunting
all over
out of
over again
again as
the gate
as two
films go
even though
though the
head to
the outcome
films for
to head
outcome is
head in
for which
is completely
which the
the studios
this time
as good
time unfortunately

unfortunately the
good as
as it
it gets

is so
an enjoyable
so bad

funny and
that people

hilarious as
both the
the upcoming

the lines
that with
lines that
hunt is

also good
role and
and you've
you've got
and easily
got a
the challenge

movie that
that while
there's also
while not
not as
as bad
bad as
a bit
bit of
it could
of chemistry
could have
chemistry between
have been
between them
isn't a
be released
a very
as the
the beginning
very good
beginning of
the gay
good film
of july
of course
seems to
stars as
course the
to have
as an
the general
have a
a slightly
the audience
audience was
he's more
more of
a plot
and so
so i
i am
from the
than a
the ground
a character
the minority
the slightly
although his
his performance
as i
performance is
i was
is good
was when
opening scenes
when i
scenes we
his character
we witness
just seems
the side
to exist
side of
in action
action as
to help
as he
he and
and his
come together
but while
played by
while watching
by scott
together in
scott glenn
in fact
fact the
attempt to
i began
the scene
began to
to rescue
scene stealer
to wonder
a small
wonder how
anyone in
girl and
dog who
in their
and her
who is
her dog
funnier than
could actually
actually like
but then
from an
like this
then again
this film
are always
william forsythe

plays the
the bad
on screen

be completely
honest i
i haven't
cuba gooding
haven't had
jerry maguire
smith who
is the
the voice
voice of
isn't as
had this
as is
bad guy
this little
little fun
character in
guy a
a mass
he is
is still
who has
still fun
has several
million dollars
a little
watching a
away to
little but
a disaster

much as
in my
as to
entire life

smith is
manages to
up the
to get
good although
it was
was still
when a

although she
to watch
she has
just happens
happens to
a fairly
doesn't just

small role
a lot
human drama
body heat

appearance as
special effects
as a

but since
a doctor
since there
and a
there must
a poorly
but this
must be
this is
be a
is primarily
plot the
the only
only thing
film and
is with
thing that
with him
and every
that gives
every scene
gives it
scene he's
soon the
it a
he's in
the now
a half
masquerading as
character is
is a
though it's
who knows
it's amazing
amazing that
fifteen minutes
that anyone
along the
minutes and
the way
and some
way they
some good
good actors
they pick
him at

up a
a pretty
most of
of their
their characters

the blame
take long
long before
be placed
placed on
his inability
in her
because the
inability to
the pace
to control
pace is
throughout the
captivated by
film we
are given
runs into
tell us
us how
will never

much time
time has

the romantic
his son
time is
son is
is taking
is not
not made
taking place
characters are
place in
in real
interesting in
real time
is easily
time it's
that they
it's that

for it
something different
allows the
to everyone
woman to
everyone to
to spend
spend time
and bruce
time with
it's an
her son
time and
crafted a
and time
loss of
a simplistic
time again
of control
story that
that only
only gets
do not
gets worse
a means
add up
means to
what starts
this movie
movie if
starts out
end to
a viewer
this fact
then he
he will
chock full
out his
full of
definately not
not like
one liners
and to
you know
know you
you are
other hand
are going
method of
going to
can appreciate
have more
appreciate the
more sex
movie for
than anyone
anyone else
else in
in school
none of
school and
probably like
and stupid
these characters
like it
it much
appears to
much better
you might
to love
better i
might think
i don't
think we
don't mean
we were
mean to
back in
as they
the 70s
they love
however that
themselves the
only one
the greatest
greatest strength
the subplots
strength of
a memorable
is remotely
exercise in
film lies
remotely interesting
in camp
not in
script but
but in
and boring
the performances
it's so
boring and
bad it's
the main
main plot
it's good
is perfect
perfect as
movie isn't
that you
all that
you can't
suit and
and tie
figure out
out if
does have
if this
have its
those who
its moments
film is
is supposed
supposed to
him as
almost all
all of
be an
an action
of which
drama or
will find
find that
sci fi
the psychotic
to put
is almost
put it
and nick
it simply
simply the
here as
the special
the image
effects of
these two
image of
two actors
film are
a hit
hit and
audience the
the truly
and miss
written for
that's right
for them
help this
above the
the earth
gets the
the larger
are well
well done
portion of
done and
of bad
is delightful
bad dialogue
delightful as
ship is
every time
her character
and he
he manages
a huge
to deliver
making it
it more
when she
lines with
the concept
concept of
of an
ease the
of even
an apartment
trying to
to land
wishes to
however is
land on
is nothing
enough but
nothing short
but that's
short of
use to
the world
world weary
is actually
the elderly
walk on
the source
source of
give me
me a
the film's
a break
humor and
and there's
there's hardly
and of
hardly ever
or how
ever a
how about
the much
a moment
about when
moment when
takes out
steal the
out her
the spotlight
her co
in another
well it
is far
far from
don't know
know if
it makes
have her
independence day
film to
so she
to visit
the water
alone in
seems that
towards the
that this
the land
her new
is effective
effective but
but once
little more
it hits
course that
hits the
than some
the director's
the effects
enough of
water is
brain dead
his trademark
is used
dead in
used and
in these
these movies
it looks
looks so
however to
i heard
the woman
more laughs
laughs from
is basically
looks at
basically a
a four
the body
body and
and says
character study
fact i
what was
i may
may even
was it
recommend the
it that
film for
for those
the character
who want
character interaction
want to
to see
said to
see how
is and
to me
and that's
how bad
me at
that's the
the real
real reason
can actually
of each
actually get
reason to
these days
see this
this motion
just when
when we
we think
visual effects
i'm sorry
can't be
picture of
your time
the non
is up
comes a
up this
is what
to show
love the
show that
the one
passes for
one that
they really
for humor
that has
humor in
has more
can and
and should
film the
should be
do with
be one
one thing
doesn't necessarily
thing has
laugh but
struck a
than with
a wrong
note with
the type
type of
with me
the fugitive
suggests the
is probably
probably one
which also
can't believe
the actors
watching this
ever made
made it
this crap
loves to
it takes
show the
watching it
believable characters
it they
they are
and tells
before and
and during
an exciting
moments of
of terror
reminded me
not have
me of
throughout this
have the
of another
this isn't
isn't an
action director
an over
renny harlin
the top
die hard
action flick
but his
the sake
sake of
of action
because he
he shows
for some
shows the
an intelligent
comic relief
adventure story
relief in
story with
in between
a real
real sense
off his
sense of
of mystery
mystery to
for instance
to it
the victims
in one
victims in
it works
works perfectly
the movie's
harrison ford
best scenes
likes to
as dr
tries to
to explain
a man
their faces
his lawyer
man who
faces but
but instead
what a
instead of
his ex
coming off
ex wife
convicted of
off as
wife is
is in
his wife
seems more
wife the
premise of
one moment
story revolves
woman is
revolves around
has an
around this
an astronaut
trust me
off into
me it
into space
not told
told in
is funny
this should
funny in
a straightforward
in context
be enough
enough to
to warrant
so the
flashbacks to
the murder
audience but
painfully obvious
are dropped
and shows
shows us
dropped from
us the
times of
the night
i won't
won't reveal
the ending
ways to
familiar with
we don't
don't get
get to
an emotional
this type
see who
who the
could probably
an audience
the killer
audience and
guess the
killer is
and i
i for
is until
for one
from this
am not
much further
not going
film review
but i
be fooled
i will
will say
on another
say that
story in
film only
has one
we might
picks up
might even
up its
the biggest
even have
during the
the last
in film
when the
and david
film doesn't
own a
that becomes
time on
up and
the details
some very
details of
flames in
moments are
and conviction
are shown
again when
at one
when you
one point
you watch
point in
the point
point of
film not
story one
action scenes
after discovering
for their
it's obvious
into an
it will
will be
across from
her family's
it's mostly
mostly just
just a
a big
them that
that she's
you'd be
be pretty
characters but
it didn't
didn't work
work for
for me
this turkey
me but
as we
anyway the
we get
get a
actors do
do as
on tv
tv and
and you
his fellow
can with
come across
with what
what they
which leads
it if
leads to
if you
you do
a fantastic
do you
train wreck
you may
it does
watch it
the naked
not at
truth is
best of
stupid plot
and she
plot and
and feel
is given
given the
watch this
good that
you didn't
because it's
is made
to take
elements like
like these
presence and
these and
and we
was a
and make
a wonderful
make them
wonderful film
to care
film a
care for
a hilarious
original and
hilarious comedy
and believable
robert duvall
packed with
with good
energetic and
and fun
watch but
is turned
turned into
out for
for a
a sequel
sequel but
tommy lee
lee jones
comes off
untimely death
seemed to
to eliminate
eliminate the
the idea
steals the
the show
show as
he still
years have
have passed
hasn't had
passed and
had many
the long
many good
stick to
a u
u s
has finally
unfortunately it's
are too
worthy of
the original
original the
film starts
is barely
after the
her performance
first one
is only
enhanced by
by her
dan aykroyd
is just
presence on
an expert
of jail
his brother
he does
does provide
provide some
some nice
has been
this and
recently died
and gives
gives one
as in
his most
film he
he first
performances to
to date
is quite
for him
freeman and
sets about
about getting
been better
getting the
better but
the band
the moment
i think
think she
moment he
back together
she just
he appears
suffered from
from a
we know
know a
poorly written
leaves a
a terrible
character a
a special
game of
special note
hole in
cat and
should go
and mouse
go to
and although
is about
about to
to occur
new characters
are created
good in
to fill
are equally
in his
fill the
his role
role but
as there
is no
still very
no way
way to
to tell
is going
because she
she was
son of
from tv's
film deals
deals with
star trek
trek the
the next
next generation
first movie
seeing her
he tries
was one
the highlights
find the
highlights of
reluctant to
to join
join his
his destiny
who killed
killed his
very talented
and spends
talented cast
spends most
impact is
is rated
movie as
rated pg

lot of
elements and
here so
and brief
so it

the worst
worst films

several years
years ago
if anyone
making this
who turns
turns out
asked to
to write
a set
set of
father who
to follow
an alien
to like
was actually
the highly
suspense or
the plan
or something
plan he
he wrote
watching the
was only
in which
then they
but did
long is
a team
their audience
team of
who should
after another
investigate the
another to
the alien
to look
aside from
now that
the terrific
costumes and
a chain
by a

his head
is simply
peter coyote
to study

i've never
never seen
seen her
look so
in length
so close
way she
she did
the pacific
did in
the early
arguably the
not only
the low
only is
low point
is she
point is
less than
is when
look at
escapes from
at but
has become
but her
become an

acting job
plan for

dealing with

really is
good one
one and
using a

likable and
top of
well written
written and
stone and
played in
in full
full force
liev schreiber
he just
together they
travel to
the deep
as any
to understand
villain in
film isn't
romantic comedy
one major
secret is
i've ever
stock footage
the meaning
meaning of
footage of
of actual
the huge
here is
of gold
think the
the guy
guy is
the heart
heart of
flat out
what is
can say
is disappointing
even more
say something
more by
something that
that just
isn't funny
makes me
me laugh
his comedic
performance here
about this
use of
happy gilmore
ending with
with its
director barry
is at
his best
be even
even worse
rather than
he goes
movie perhaps
perhaps the
effects the
the problem
problem here
that can
proves to
is he
me that
be said
is making
making a
said for
the picture
picture is
fiction film
the faint
film it
it has
own as
has some
a leading
effects but
leading man
man in
most intriguing
only as
his roles
as some
roles in
his previous
the television
previous films
screen the
to suggest
than to
rated r
show and
r for
and let
for violence
let the
violence and
actors and
and language
language and
the viewer's
and would
carry the
be acceptable
gives him
acceptable for
him a
for teenagers
character that
ever since
that for
did with
the haunting
first time
time he
that could
he actually
actually has
a reasonable
to fit
fit into
hollywood has
attempted to
a low
as far
low budget
far as
to produce
budget film
more and
film but
and more
but that
more films
that requires
films about
these films
does in
audience a
to muster
a look
look into
have some
actors to
that really
to give
talents and
not impossible
impossible and
performances and
and simply
is usually
simply put
just so
they don't
if it's
not this
this the
moment is
about what
he sings
is real
a song
we do
song for
feel for
greater than
for these
he claims
than you
you would
would expect
and do
not get
guilty of
their heads
of all
writing it
it while
big bucks
while in
bucks for
for his
his actors
anyone familiar
and does
not really
it after
really get
and or
after his
performance and
and why
him this
we have
the part
so incredibly
part that
incredibly stupid
a minor
stupid that
had me
can't take
the expedition
take it
of you
you who
a cast
cast of
world wide
fraction of
the price
are probably
aware of
a breath
breath of
more powerful
for movies
air and
film like
and while
like alien
was with
with only
like all
takes a
the movies
sums up
extremely well
plot has
well with
to finish
up there
more than
than enough
and ridiculous
hilarious moments
actors but
moments in
but never
the extreme
first hour
regarding the
pay off
make up
up for
off for
for any
and technology
technology and
the second
second half
centers around
just not
not an
very important
more specifically
it follows

i just
just want
film opens
opens with
to know
this sequel
i laughed
sequel to

based on
the laughs

problem is
film's plot
an attempt
to revive
to score
what i've
i've said
as usual
it's just
of computer
walking in
in with
but what
obsessive compulsive
what we
are left
left with
with is
i thought
little too
thought this
movie was
actually pretty
nearly two
running around
pretty good
the visuals
visuals and
young women
women and
and obviously
and american
thanks to

and what
especially during

scenes involving
can do
nothing more
do this
movie makes
cgi the
look a
little bit
bit too

such as
too many
to list
to sum
moments where

in such
such a
although at
a short
at times
times it
span of
it too
unsure of
becoming a

of himself
seem a

the opposite
far fetched
for control
it should
be much
on one
more believable
one hand
hand it
a fast

fast paced
including a
a painful
film on
involving an
an instant
a frightening
horror film
film didn't
watch is
a sequence
sequence involving
three of
it to
to think
be successful
think they
with two
two young
would have

portrayed in
the boys
focus on
one the
the more
waste of
more action
if there's
there's one
with one
offensive and
one character
and plays
thing i
serving as
just can't
the comic
can't stand
to generate
that would
laughs the
film despite
problem with
despite some
here's a
a note
note to
to all
had an
an innocent
film makers
charm to
three characters
films are
it the
more effective
the sequel
sequel is
as comic
the emotions
knows what
for themselves
audience members
one liner
want and
if they
they were
were trying
them the
the many
a horror
action comedy
people in
comedy it
encounter with
have helped
unhappy and
becomes a
the situation
situation is
early on
running gag
as does
my giant
but unfortunately
that uses
well meaning
be impossible
with such
then there's
such high
the slapstick
i forgot
scene between
between a
given some
a sword
i watched
some new
watched it
that there
material is
and an
are other
an army
army of
ways of
of getting
really well
done it
it had
had the
original in
the feel
feel of
me was
of slapstick
was that
slapstick comedy
i wasn't
character with
up or
or even
a chainsaw
even the
chainsaw and
the slightest
slightest bit
a pre
that matter
that will
a forced
of darkness
contrived and
entertaining and
and funny
the box
funny it
it feels
the word
of place
though that
place but
that in
but at
but i've
in its
least it's
chosen to
break from
use it
in some
it because
the makers
wanted to
to create
create a
playing a
a cute
film here
of on
here it
whole the
a premise
who also
premise that
is pure
that might
penned the
could not
from beginning
liked the
to end
his sights
entertaining the
i must
down with
funny but
but it's
my review
it's still
still a
turns and
as well
well as
movie theatre

while a
to expect

good sound
maybe it
will work
were almost
that's what
some people

here the
best thing
gets to

do is
christopher walken

sequences are
some reason
no matter
in most

of intriguing
for much
its running
are all
real star
more impressive
anyway in
as my
the scenes

witness the
murder of

the serial
strives for

surprised me
me because
it actually

none other
other than

i also
that's exactly
trailers for
exactly the
the kind

but enough
enough about
the flaws
now it's
action sequences
talk about
sequences which
me with
with little

are less

because they
they spend
spend most
a stylish
slow the
story line
great looking
looking and
and quirky
reminiscent of

with no
shame because
doesn't have

be that
very little
inside a
more recent
who claims
claims to
the aid
aid of
know how
an anti
co writer
anti climactic
pretty much
a solid
throw away
of my
plans and
this big
summer blockbuster
land of
proof that
or as
from that
do it
they say
point on
say in
if he
in french
hodgepodge of
could it
of scenes
scenes and
script was
ripped off
off from
it took
people to
you have
and dead
an adult
that are
points of
show up
up until
last half
handling of
half hour
hour and
and even
even then
early in
children who
then we
don't see
see anything
character gets
anything that
that its
a coma
a river
to live
virtually the
have come
but if
if your
so why
why did
did they
more from
smith and
actor of
movies that
for what
towards a
amounts to
help but
a cameo
cameo appearance
them on
saddled with
their own
almost too
a bad
great to
to overcome
with great
movie on
how a
agree to
a positive
appear in
never truly
note i
i could
honestly say
of hollywood
hollywood the
the remaining

the score
an ability
ability to
a mean
a macho
a frightened

derivative of
a hard
hard time
a dozen

effects are
it it's
are never
it's really
really just
later he
movie there
too obvious
a couple
obvious that
couple of
of ways
a soap
to define
a decidedly
movie which
of having
outlook on
on life
having her
life one
one night
like she's
for two
off like
lot and
a fight
a two
fight and
doesn't feel
good it
first two
comprised of
of about
about twenty
a brief
moment of
arrives on
earth a
a pair
pair of
makes his
first a
good example
pale in
in comparison
he moves
meet a
moves into
a wacky
last year's
black sheep
also some
form the
product placement
the titular
film most
most notably
fast and
bond with
very few
rules the
is generally
the t
t shirt
armed with
just one
one word
charisma and
or to
an attractive

i e
however when
of white
a vegas
dead end
such is
does it
case with
this movie's
them at
and begins
by peter
the verge
fare much
verge of
better with
best as
the equivalent
equivalent of
a fake
dedicated to

using it
character from
the innocent
desperate for
for fun
fun and
something more
winds up
be as
and jack
as she's
that things
things have
have gone
the simple
is after
fact is
the right
after this
is this
right amount
point when
of genuine
funny at
wonder to
first i
did find
find myself
how far
of little
despite all
something original
jokes but
all this
but when
a disappointing
not alone
my interest
plot twist
nor a
compared to
well he
movie in
in many
character and
that everything
leave it
good people
be quite
far less
was too
impressive as
to actually
make people
though not
people not
movie doesn't
doesn't show
show any
and for
excited about
about its
as for
on dvd
two separate
kids the
a cop
mind the
of many
seems out
to prove
prove that
i'm still
can play
characters the
being that
feel it
awful the
nothing to
first and
and most
be saying
them they're
saying that
they're so
dvd release
expect the
features the
the credits
are good
the international
good for
to read
the soul
the message
message that
version of
which runs
the print
from it
i'll be
surprised if
is presented
presented in
yes it's
its original
up here
it's true
original theatrical
true that
theatrical aspect
there and
aspect ratio
and i'll
ratio of

isn't even
even close
enhanced for
for 16x9
16x9 televisions
being as
funny as
the others
which were
were actually
fun in
the disc
include a
a full
oliver stone
ways but
commentary track
of other
with director
other things
is less
less a
and special
a message
movie than
first off
attempt at
the excellent
a joke
the national
for all
all his
the making
making of
a feature
really nothing
find any
why but
but maybe
and far
is even
in depth
didn't want
accompanied by
be associated
associated with
score from
who constantly
up on
film that's
saying a
especially when
on this
you look
at what
version is
of self
is incredible
else the
the company
think you
you were
context the
the joke
works but
but like
images are
the latest
be another
people will
screen and
will get
get it
free of
good laugh
proud to
and others
for reasons
can guess
spoil the

the infamous
he's been
of late
a limited
he sure
played a
who went
here in
the charming
end the
bottom line
line with
is having
under his
having fun
his belt
ass and
the short
never before
and making
short film
making sure
before seen
sure there's
director's cut
cut of
around to
an oscar
oscar nomination
minutes long
long the
granted that
this was
consist of
was his
you got
his first
first attempt
which don't
feature length
length film
of note
one really
really great
except for
few moments
moments which
instead we
screen time
straight from
have you
during his
bland and
all at
the violent
loved the
movie are
violent and
entire film
wrapped in
isn't anything
a soundtrack
one question
to no
no surprise
surprise to
of cinema
anyone that
i'd never
you never
movie comes
sat down
did like
a music
music video
why the
the need
with plenty
need to
i mean
released to
the directing
directing debut
smart enough
and tony
actually works
works the
so when
it starts
the dvd
into my
down in
a way
way of
the gun
had no
gun on
no idea
idea what
on us
a thoughtful
us and
what to
i knew
knew the
film wasn't
i never
never had
had any
any interest
in it
latter is
is true
true for
a shot
picture with
enjoyed the
the impressive
the overall
of work
put into
was as
well and
and did
did i
is poor
i mention
was rather
impressed with
opening sequence
movie no
sequence which
which made
made me
well i
the tagline
and wonder
without her
the rich
rich and
but to
be honest
take up
however it
the chase
in blood
try to
the nightmare
on both
course it's
it's no
no secret
who wants
see them
them both
i give
give up
an annoying
little film
i even
that serves
with that
slick and
in mind
and fast
not once
also like
there's very
these types
three times
times to
of guy
movies a
are fun
definitely a
foul mouthed
but a
the table
although their
does offer
offer a
it appears
appears that
story some
that much
twists and
and turns
in so
spent on
many ways
ways that
sets and
and costumes
makes you
you wonder
the five
for everyone
talented and
everyone but
and high
high profile
movie there's
who enjoy
development in
get involved
story also
an embarrassing
guys and
as mr
film stars
finding out
sandra bullock
and nicole
nicole kidman
really are
are so
way through
happened the
below the
long line
recommend this
the start
their parents
or any
liv tyler
children and
they go
the love
live with
leave your
sticks out
at home
out like
the present
baby and
was quite
present day
on what
of that
was trying
put on
one to
on she
she looks
return to
i really
more interesting
interesting is
home and
and meets
the campy
stuck in
a dark
the ghetto
to nothing
two dimensional
meets and
and falls
falls in
neck and
character he
and love
love it
a sweet
hams it
man has
has two
two children
is suitably
i got
when her
but again
again he
husband is
is hit
nothing but
hit by
by this
a flat
a truck
character i
mean it
and killed
i didn't
it really
me up
of it
the predictable
she's not
the devil
since she
although a
in disguise
a disappointment
over it
in writing
writing and
you won't
about two
won't be
two minutes
success in
in acting
acting the
falling in
film certainly
get her
her after
after having
so don't
and wonderful
don't be
production design
turn away
can't save
save a
movie especially
especially a
body in
whether she
this mess
or not
add to
not and
dog of
the dead
suited to

directing a
to mention
me i
update of
light hearted

drama the
way and
the heartbreak
good idea

that everyone
that i'd
i'd seen
after seeing

far behind
behind me

mild mannered
wasn't just
entertaining in
any way

no plot
we've got
the highlight
instead it
story of
camera angles
make this
taking over
in high
appeal to
whatever the
although it's
are handled
concept is

is awful
parents and
getting to
be what
more likely
what you
you could
call a
sloppy and
and occasionally
reason why
good script
and actors
actors can
can take
be in
easy to
the son
in every
scene involving
them they
take off
the search
a miss
silly and
short story
story which

no attempt
nowhere in

them out
out into

mainly because
the above
so little
little about

especially the
