brings back
memories of

was an
to anyone
mess that

as i
i was
even though

though the
when i
the outcome
outcome is
the side
is completely
side of
but while
while watching
as good
good as
as it
i began

began to
to wonder
wonder how
is an
an enjoyable
anyone in
in their
funny and

hilarious as
could get
get away

lines that
honest i
i haven't
haven't had
had this
this little
hunt is
little fun
is also
also good
watching a
a disaster
disaster film
film in
and easily
in my
entire life
the challenge
there's also
up the
a bit
bit of
of chemistry
it was
chemistry between
was still
between them
fun to
to watch
as the
doesn't just
the gay
just have
seems to
to have
have a
a slightly
human drama
he's more
more of
special effects
effects and
a plot
and a
a poorly
than a
a character
plot the
the only
although his
only thing
his performance
thing that
performance is
that gives
is good
gives it
it a
his character
a half
just seems
to exist
to help
is a
come together
together in
in fact
fifteen minutes
minutes and
fact the
and some
the scene
some good
scene stealer
good actors
making the
most of
of their
dog who
their characters
who is
funnier than
begins in
in an
but then
then again
year the
the year
are always
on screen
it in
the future
cuba gooding
fire in
the sky
sky is
jerry maguire
is showing
smith who
is the
on a
the voice
a local
voice of
movie theater
it back
back to
to a
a line
line of
isn't as
as is
at night
character in
he is
is still
still fun
at the
the dark
a little
little but
but not
these are
not so
so much
much as
as to
elijah wood
and sarah
smith is
good although
leelee sobieski
although she
she has
a fairly
discovers a
small role
and his
sends a
a photo
body heat
the unknown
makes an
an appearance
to an
appearance as
as a
a doctor
who then
then is
but this
is able
this is
able to
is primarily
to determine
film and
and every
every scene
scene he's
he's in
character is
though it's
it's amazing
amazing that
that anyone
him at
at all
and this
the films
main problem
totally unbelievable
would ever
she doesn't
fall in
in love
love with
the correct
with him
path of
naturally the
the film
of this
forces her
her to
to fall
in about
about a
few seconds
character seems
off to
to go
the information
too quickly
i would
anyone with
with a
character like
but is
would be
is killed
be able
killed in
to turn
in a
a reckless
car accident
a nice
a year
it would
passes and
would take
and nothing
take a
nothing is
heard about
long time
about it
it again
much longer
longer than
we are
than this
film would
introduced to
would like
like to
to make
make out
t a
direction is
if a
she gets
but he
he usually
a job
manages to
job to
to get
to investigate
get an
investigate a
a possible
cover up
up in
the government
he handles
handles the
the comedy
better than
than the
james cromwell
ones he

woman who
tends to
pile on

having an
an affair
on to
affair with
to much
a girl
girl named

out to
exactly how
to do
how to
which is
is to
make the
that she
feel good
she is
is looking
by the
looking for
end of
the movie
movie the
movie is
film that
girl is
is such
is pretty
good fun
that the
the running
running time
time passes
how it
before she
a fun
she can
fun movie
can use
movie even
though it
it may
may be
and certainly
worth seeing
seeing if
to push
just for
her car
off the
the road
not quite
they take
quite as
take her
her in
in to
to meet
pardon the
meet the
the president

but still
the united

morgan freeman
and director of
keep the
returns to the
so they
they can
to the big
the big screen
it and
and then
hold a
a press
she wants
wants to
probably the most
and they

on the screen

seat and
and the
the chance
chance for
for the
has a good
reveal the
the public
and their
their plans
send a
a massive
to destroy
it before
before it
it can
a plan
is their
their only
only hope
hope for
for survival
a computer
people at
at random
these people
people are
are the
the ones
ones who
who will
will go
go into
into a
a large
last seen in
so that
the impact
impact of
kill off
the entire
human race
after two
two years
years the
the dust
actually it
much much
years from
from what
what i
i understand
understand and
the humans
could come
come back
the surface
and start
start over
over the
the rest
rest of
the plot
plot is
is your
but there
there is
is one
worth mentioning
and her
her father
a very
relationship that
the final
involving the
the two
two characters
characters is
and emotional
hit it off
it's a
a shame
shame that
off in the
that nothing
nothing else
in the end
else is
course we
good will hunting
we all
all know
know that
even though the
impact the
surface the
the outcome is
the title
the previews
as good as
good as it
show it
as it gets
it by
by doing
doing this
no tension
can be
drawn from
from any
attempt to
to stop
stop the
because we
get away with
away with the
that it
it won't
mimi leder
came from
from her
episodes of
a bit of
the hit
of chemistry between
television show
film debut
seems to have
to have a
was the
the peacemaker
a pathetic
pathetic and
more of a
of a plot
action film
film well
well this
his performance is
creating a
a film
just seems to
worse than
than that
that one
come together in
stay away
in fact the
from the
screen or
or at
at least
least the
the action
action genre
the blame
but then again
be placed
placed on
because the
the pace
pace is
throughout the
film we
are given
tell us
who is the
us how
is the voice
the voice of
how much
much time
time has
has passed
it goes
goes from
hours it
it literally
feels like
he is still
time is
is taking
taking place
place in
in real
not so much
real time
so much as
time it's
as to be
it's that
isn't all
she has a
all to
to blame
blame for
for it
makes an appearance
and bruce
but this is
crafted a
a simplistic
story that
that only
only gets
gets worse
what starts
character is so
starts out
chock full
full of
and this is
this is the
one liners
you know
know you
you are
are going
going to
have more
more sex
than anyone
anyone else
else in
fall in love
in school
in love with
love with him
school and
and stupid
you might
might think
think we
to fall in
we were
back in
the 70s
only one
the subplots
is remotely
remotely interesting
while the
and boring
boring and
the main
main plot
that you
you can't
figure out
out if
if this
film is
is supposed
supposed to
be an
an action
drama or
sci fi
to put
put it
it simply
simply the
the special
effects of
film are
are a
seems to go
a hit
hit and
and miss
that's right
anyone with a
above the
the earth
would be able
be able to
are well
well done
done and
ship is
it would take
but the
a huge
than this film
making it
this film would
it more
would like to
the concept
concept of
of even
trying to
to land
land on
enough but
but that's
manages to get
to get an
out of the
is actually
of the audience
walk on
give me
me a
a break
better than the
and of
the much
well it
it is
is far
far from
it makes
there's also a
independence day
the water
towards the
the land
is effective
effective but
but once
it hits
hits the
the effects
sets out to
water is
out to do
is used
used and
it looks
which is to
looks so
is to make
to make the
that i
make the audience
i heard
more laughs
laughs from
by the end
the end of
end of the
fact i
of the movie
i may
the movie the
may even
the movie is
recommend the
movie is a
film for
for those
is a bit
those who
who want
want to
to see
see how
how bad
can actually
actually get
these days
just when
when we
we think
the running time
visual effects
can't be
comes a
film to
to show
show that
that they
they really
is a fun
even though it
it may be
can and
and should
should be
be one
one thing
thing has
struck a
a wrong
note with
not quite as
with me
which also
the actors
loves to
show the
before and
and during
after a
moments of
of terror
reminded me
me of
parker and
of another
action director
renny harlin
which despite
despite its
die hard
close to
because he
to being
he shows
being a
a conventional
shows the
movie director
faces of
the victims
victims in
has returned
returned to
to his
his unique
likes to
brand of
of film
film making
their faces
a romantic
faces but
but instead
black comedy
instead of
comedy about
coming off
off as
about love
seems more
betrayal and
and self
one moment
has an
an astronaut
may not
not be
off into
be the
into space
this should
themes to
be enough
enough to
to warrant
a motion
motion picture
audience but
approach to
the characters
characters and
and shows
shows us
makes for
us the
for an
an intriguing
if not
not always
movie it
is said
said that
ways to
an emotional
that most
most viewers
from an
an audience
audience and
love his
and i
his work
i for
for one
or hate
hate it
am not
it until
not going
be fooled
had not
on another
not been
film only
impressed by
by his
picks up
his movies
up its
movies i
i found
during the
the last
his last
effort to
irritating and
when the
to discover
pick up
discover that
up and
i liked
some very
there are
moments are
are several
are shown
reasons for
for this
again when
this but
when you
you watch
one is
is that
some of
for their
aspects of
of his
it's obvious
characters here
here are
it will
are more
will be
more like
real people
it's mostly
mostly just
people with
just a
a big
problems the
the story
story is
the acting
acting is
is top
characters but
top notch
it didn't
didn't work
work for
in short
for me
me but
anyway the
has created
actors do
created a
do as
a world
as much
world that
that it's
as they
it's worth
can with
with what
what they
two hours
they are
hours in
introduces us
us to
to two
the naked
truth is
jonny lee
best of
lee miller
miller is
and she
a cold
is given
given the
her character
is made
his young
young wife
presence and
and we
to care
for her
care for
her part
robert duvall
obsessed with
energetic and
and fun
having a
a baby
watch but
but his
she never
attempts to
is turned
to interact
turned into
interact with
with her
her husband
a human
comes off
interested in
in is
he still
hasn't had
had many
few days
many good
when she's
stick to
after he
he refuses
refuses to
are too
this stuff
to find
find someone
someone else
else to
to play
is barely
play the
the role
role of
the other
her performance
nick nolte
is only
nolte and
enhanced by
by her
presence on
are an
an older
but they're
no more
he does
does provide
provide some
some nice
a mysterious
has been
their past
this and
and gives
gives one
his most
performances to
to date
is quite
a matter
matter of
for him
but since
could have
have been
been better
better but
lucky to
but i
i think
to touch
think she
she just
they have
have an
suffered from
from a
poorly written
he can
character a
a special
special note
around as
should go
as he
go to
he wants
that no
bond is
is established
a result
result of
of these
of emotional
good in
in his
them is
his role
is palpable
role but
the four
to me
because she
she was
to fix
the inside
inside of
from tv's
the apartment
star trek
trek the
shares with
the next
next generation
seeing her
two of
of them
was one
them are
the highlights
attracted to
highlights of
to one
one another
another and
doesn't take
very talented
take long
talented cast
long before
impact is
in her
is rated
rated pg
pg for
elements and
captivated by
and brief
runs into
the worst
worst films
a hotel
films of
year and
and if
if it
is any
to accompany
him on
of things
things to
a weekend
to come
this summer
the mountains
could be
the romantic
luckily the
the x
x files
characters are
is coming
coming up
are interesting
and hopefully
interesting in
in that
be more
more successful
of love
that this
film will
will do
something different
do so
to everyone
everyone to
because it
it just
just isn't
it's an
isn't worth
loss of
of control
with special
done by
a means
means to
end to
and with
a score
composed by
oscar winner
out his
james horner
and to
one might
might have
have expected
expected this
method of
this to
more fun
to witness
it's not
none of
not when
these characters
appears to
to love
hit the
you almost
wish it
they love
it could
could just
themselves the
just take
the greatest
take this
greatest strength
strength of
along with
film lies
with it
not in
the script
script but
but in
the performances
is perfect
but it doesn't
perfect as
it doesn't really
suit and
and tie
much of a
him as
will find
find that
summer movie season
that he
is almost
and it also
here as
the image
image of
came out in
is delightful
delightful as
a few months
and he
he manages
to deliver
the first film
first film was
lines with
ease the
and one of
however is
of the best
is nothing
nothing short
short of
i had ever
had ever seen
ever seen the
the world
world weary
the source
source of
the film's
humor and
and there's
there's hardly
hardly ever
ever a
a moment
moment when
when she
steal the
the spotlight
her co
co stars
i don't
don't know
know if
head to head
it seems
seems that
this movie
little more
than some
is so bad
so bad that
the director's
enough of
his trademark
however to
is basically
basically a
to be released
a four
the beginning of
character study
is not
of course the
the character
character interaction
is and
the audience was
and that's
that's the
the real
real reason
reason to
see this
this motion
and so i
in the minority
picture of
the non
as i was
was when i
love the
the one
one that
that has
has more
on the side
more to
the side of
do with
than with
i began to
like this film
close to being
to being a
to be completely
has returned to
of film making
may not be
not be the
be the most
but it was
a motion picture
fun to watch
approach to the
to the characters
the characters and
characters and their
makes for an
special effects and
effects and a
movie it is
the only thing
only thing that
or hate it
i had not
had not been
the most of
most of their
of their characters
to discover that
that i liked
there are several
it in the
in the future
in the sky
some of the
of the most
it back to
the story is
and the acting
the acting is
is top notch
has created a
a world that
introduces us to
jonny lee miller
is able to
a few seconds
for her part
killed in a
to interact with
with her husband
he refuses to
she decides to
to find someone
to play the
the role of
to investigate a
up in the
nick nolte and
a woman who
having an affair
an affair with
affair with a
as a matter
a matter of
to use the
as much as
that she is
is looking for
in the film
as a result
the film that
a result of
the two of
two of them
of them are
to one another
one another and
and it doesn't
it doesn't take
doesn't take long
to meet the
the president of
president of the
of the united
the united states
so they can
it and then
him on a
she wants to
wants to be
of the characters
the characters are
for the first
to the public
a means to
none of these
these people are
of these characters
are the ones
the ones who
go into a
much as they
so that the
the impact of
impact of the
of the film
the film lies
not in the
in the script
the script but
but in the
is perfect as
perfect as the
from what i
that he is
come back to
back to the
here as the
the image of
the rest of
rest of the
of the plot
the plot is
but there is
there is one
he manages to
is nothing short
nothing short of
as the world
the two characters
it's a shame
a shame that
the source of
much of the
of the film's
of course we
we all know
all know that
know that the
it and the
i don't know
don't know if
is the film
the film to
but it seems
it seems that
seems that this
that this movie
this movie is
is a little
to stop the
a little more
episodes of the
is basically a
and that's the
the real reason
reason to see
to see this
this motion picture
stay away from
away from the
the one that
that has more
more to do
or at least
to do with
at least the
of the blame
the fugitive
be placed on
is probably
probably one
ever made
the pace is
made it
it takes
believable characters
throughout the film
and tells
the film we
an exciting
film we are
we are given
throughout this
this isn't
isn't an
an over
the top
action flick
the sake
sake of
of action
an intelligent
adventure story
story with
a real
real sense
sense of
of mystery
mystery to
to it
it works
works perfectly
harrison ford
stars as
as dr
a man
man who
convicted of
his wife
wife the
premise of
story revolves
revolves around
around this
to blame for
not told
told in
a straightforward
flashbacks to
the murder
are dropped
dropped from
times of
the night
what starts out
we don't
don't get
get to
for the audience
see who
who the
the killer
killer is
chock full of
is until
much further
into the
story in
we might
might even
even have
are going to
going to have
to have more
anyone else in
film doesn't
time on
the details
details of
you might think
and conviction
not the
the point
point of
back in the
story one
action scenes
only one of
as we
we get
get a
his fellow
while the rest
which leads
leads to
a fantastic
train wreck
it does
does not
not at
the main plot
plot is so
that you can't
watch this
if this film
because it's
this film is
to take
is supposed to
supposed to be
elements like
to be an
like these
these and
and make
make them
original and
and believable
tommy lee
lee jones
to put it
steals the
the show
show as
the special effects
of this film
a u
this film are
u s
hit and miss
an expert
the moment
moment he
he appears
we know
know a
game of
cat and
well done and
and mouse
is about
about to
to occur
are equally
as there
is no
is a huge
no way
way to
to tell
is going
the concept of
film deals
deals with
he tries
tries to
find the
who killed
killed his
not have
a lot
on the surface
lot of
here so
so it
stuart and
script and
and of course
that make
film as
as great
great as
is just
well it is
use his
it is far
is far from
intelligence and
himself and
and doing
and it makes
doing his
his own
work is
is very
very interesting
just as
as little
to why
why his
wife was
was killed
so as
he learns
more so
so do
do we
using all
all their
skills to
him down
down at
at one
one point
and it looks
they run
run into
into each
each other
other and
a great
from the audience
just too
for them
them he
he leaves
in fact i
show his
his innocence
the film for
innocence and
film for those
help him
for those who
solve the
who want to
the mystery
want to see
to see how
is its
of humor
humor there
great sense
his two
a film to
to show that
are trying
to catch
they believe
and should be
believe to
be a
a dangerous
yet they
talk with
with each
in any
any kind
kind of
to show the
final act
with another
out who
reminded me of
him and
and although
although we
a typical
fight scene
scene the
the case
case is
the man
along and
realize this
until the
end when
put the
but instead of
the pieces
coming off as
maybe the
scene is
much but
it still
still has
a believable
atmosphere to
this should be
that makes
be enough to
makes the
enough to warrant
it's all
all the
the motions
the audience but
go through

in full
a speeding
full force
as any
villain in
romantic comedy
arguably the
i've ever
the low
low point
point is
is when
the true
when he
escapes from
here is
think the
the guy
a motorcycle
guy is
flat out
using a
can say
he shoots
say something
something that
straight out
that just
isn't funny
top of
makes me
me laugh
and when
his comedic
performance here
he just
happy gilmore
film he
film isn't
he goes
stock footage
footage of
proves to
of actual
me that
own as
a leading
leading man

with its
gives him
him a

even worse

he actually
actually has
has to
to fit
movie perhaps
fit into
perhaps the
as far
far as
that can
be said
said for
the picture
picture is
the faint
does in
have some
not as
as bad
bad as
his talents
as some
talents and
the television
just so
moment is
rated r
r for
he sings
for violence
violence and
a song
and language
song for
language and
and would
he claims
be acceptable
acceptable for
for teenagers
writing it
it while
while in
it after
after his
him this
the part
part that
had me
for a
a breath
breath of
air and
and while
film like
like all
the only film
takes a
plot has
to finish
up there
more than
than enough
in new york
hilarious moments
new york and
moments in
first hour
l a and
make up
up for
for any
the second
second half
very important
but who
who cares
are extremely
is the first
the first of
first of the
of the new
the experience
experience is
enjoyable in
in addition
addition to
to this
this i
i can't
can't imagine
imagine anyone
seeing the
the preview
and not
that of the
not wanting
wanting to
see the
is pointless
to even
cut to a
written this
review i
i just
just want
to know
i laughed
i think that
where one of
member of the
of the human
the human race
ever seen a
seen a movie
the time of
just about every
of their lives
turn in the
the wedding singer
into the middle
the middle of
even though i
middle of a
very hard to
even in the
in the beginning
the beginning the
the plot of
plot of this
on screen but
and with the
but i don't
i don't care
not even a
even a little
adam sandler is
to get away
get away from
because i was
i was laughing
in a movie
they manage to
a movie that
being in a
trapped in a
in the opening
the opening scenes
he seems like
seems like a
as it does
happy go lucky
good job of
right down to
down to the
is a good
to tell the
the whole world
up to that
to be the
be the next
at his own
looking for the
for the little
at the altar
with his life
his life in
she is engaged
is engaged to
in her own
who has a
love each other
making this film
while watching the
aside from the
i've never seen
so close to
close to the
to the way
the way she
not only is
to look at
look at but
who will be
a good one
that the character
goes for the
the character is
well written and
the other three
is just as
i've ever seen
i think the
but in this
in this film
this film he
to me that
that he can
so that he
man in a
in a romantic
a romantic comedy
in the woods
gives him a
a character that
that for the
is what the
the first time
as far as
and this film
he does in
to help them
and the movie
movie is just
along the way
is just so
perhaps the best
is when he
who turns out
turns out to
out to have
to have been
in a good
him this is
a breath of
and while the
while the film
is a long
towards the end
because the plot
the plot has
up there are
there are more
are more than
more than enough
moments in the
in the first
the first hour
make up for
during the second
the second half
over his head
but who cares
funny and the
the experience is
in addition to
i can't imagine
can't imagine anyone
not wanting to
to see the
see the film
the film in
film in that
that it is
for me to
this review i
to know that
based on
the same
same name
name the
the mummy
starts off
off with
the high
straight out of
of the top
the top of
for his
top of the
his mistress
by being
and when he
way possible
up having
having his
and being
covered in
off in a
all while
while still
still alive
thousand years
years later
where a
when the film
a soldier
the film isn't
a young
her brother
by john
john hannah
in finding
finding the
the book
book of
the process
problem is
to revive
walking in
in with
i thought
thought this
movie was
was actually
actually pretty
pretty good
good the
the visuals
visuals and
and obviously
all they
a ton
ton of
of detail
manages to be
the images
especially during
scenes involving
even worse than
worse than the
cgi the
the computer
for some
such as
moments where
that can be
where the
can be said
goes after
after the
be said for
people who
said for the
him after
after all
the picture is
all those
film attempts
way too
too much
much in
in such
such a
a short
span of
becoming a
it's not as
of war
not as bad
for control
as bad as
on one
one hand
hand it
a fast
of the television
fast paced
film on
a frightening
horror film
and on
a hilarious
hilarious comedy
it is rated
is rated r
it to
be successful
rated r for
r for violence
would have
for violence and
to focus
focus on
one the
the more
more action
with one
and would be
one character
would be acceptable
serving as
the comic
be acceptable for
comic relief
that would
the problem
ever since
problem with
it has
three characters
as comic
hollywood has
one liner
attempted to
if they
to produce
they were
were trying
more and
make a
and more
a horror
action comedy
comedy it
more films
films about
have helped
it were
these films
early on
on in
film but
but unfortunately
audience a
a look
look into
be impossible
impossible and
then there's
that really
there's the
the slapstick
scene between
not impossible
between a
a sword
is usually
and an
an army
army of
if it's
really well
not this
done it
it had
this the
had the
the feel
feel of
of slapstick
about what
slapstick comedy
what is
is real
a chainsaw
chainsaw and
greater than
of darkness
than you
you would
entertaining and
would expect
and funny
funny it
it feels
guilty of
of all
of place
all of
place but
but at
least it's
anyone familiar
break from
familiar with
and or
playing a
of on
whole the
so incredibly
incredibly stupid
is pure
stupid that
from beginning
to end
can't take
entertaining the
take it
i must
my review
movie theatre
turn the
those of
the sound
of you
while a
you who
good sound
were almost
i walked
walked out
world wide
the theatre
sound is
is particularly
and will
will make
are probably
make you
aware of
if you're
you're not
for movies
when they
showing the
the trailer
trailer for
of days
was so
the movies
i couldn't
couldn't make
based on the
sums up
extremely well
by the same
the same name
well with
starts off with
off with the
and ridiculous
the extreme
regarding the
in the most
and technology
technology and
one hundred
centers around
more specifically
it follows
follows the
the exploits
exploits of
murphy a
played by john
be extremely
the book of
in the process
because if
problem is that
were not
is that the
not for
for that
who knows
where his
his career
this movie was
film opens
opens with
being arrested
he was
a ton of
use a
until he
years old
film then
up at
at that
year old
the people who
away at
all those who
meets up
up with
unfortunately the film
the film attempts
film attempts to
attempts to be
way too much
in such a
angelina jolie
matthew lillard
it is a
a fast paced
film on the
on the other
the phantom
and on the
who are
are basically
do what
for it to
it to be
to be successful
the film would
film would have
would have to
to focus on
next to
computer and
the comic relief
not get
get caught
that would be
the problem with
the fbi
problem with this
with this film
oh and
film is that
and as
is that it
that it has
sub plot
also tries
to woo
if they were
trying to make
to make a
film really
really i
it would have
would have helped
can't think
think of
if it were
much more
early on in
on in the
say about
the film but
about the
film's plot
what i've
i've said
and then there's
then there's the
it's just
a bunch
bunch of
of computer
an army of
obsessive compulsive
it had the
little too
the feel of
running around
thanks to
unfamiliar with
now has
out of place
of place but
but at least
at least it's
and what
a break from
can do
do this
movie makes
look a
on the whole
little bit
bit too
their time
time and
from beginning to
beginning to end
too many
to list
to sum
a terrible
film if
you're looking
film about
closer to
to what
what goes
goes on
the sound is
real world
world i
will make you
i suggest
although at
if you're not
at times
times it
when they were
it too
the trailer for
trailer for the
may seem
seem a
end of days
far fetched
it was so
it should
be much
more believable
writer director
murder mystery
film didn't
than anything
anything else
by how
how many
to think
think they
and manages
with in
is portrayed
style over
portrayed in
of plot
is somewhat
waste of
cult film
but some
while it's
it's certainly
certainly not
not perfect
repeated viewings
more and more
nonetheless a
thriller the
story follows
follows a
visit to
the audience a
where he
he discovers
discovers that
that a
a serial
serial killer
is on
inspired by
his latest
the police
on his
his back
back for
he decides
a personal
interest in
case and
he soon
soon becomes
drawn into
a mystery
where all
all is
seems the
about what is
what is real
a fine
performance by
he brings
charm and
you would expect
character which
an interesting
to both
the violence
the books
of all of
all of these
real life
around him
him the
anyone familiar with
a fascinating
back the
facade of
to reveal
world where
in all
all its
has become
become a
is perhaps
those of you
date and
and there
of you who
is much
underneath the
here it
may take
least two
two or
or three
to appreciate
the psychological
on the world
play in
that respect
the full
full length
version and
fans will
will enjoy
aware of the
needless to
say for
no denying
many of
action and
and murder
sequences are
in the movies
plenty of
of intriguing
are all
more impressive
the fact
fact that
that in
well with the
with the first
his scenes
scenes with
rather than
and deep
works like
to the extreme
red and
set design
design and
vision of
world and
mix of
the perfect
has much
much to
to recommend
recommend it
it no
no question
the back
back of
mind is
the narrative
some critics
argue that
the exploits of
doesn't matter
matter in
films but
all films
films to
point where
deserve to
to feel
feel cheated
way if
if you
you don't
don't want
know the
the solution
solution to
for the film
about an
an hour
hour into
story takes
takes an
an unexpected
we witness
witness the
murder of
the serial
himself by
by a
who we
is none
none other
other than
the author
apparently the
the murders
the film opens
film opens with
the remainder
remainder of
opens with a
with a young
it's time
time to
to settle
wife he
is finally
revealed to
to us
us as
killer in
the twist
you see
are supposed
into thinking
thinking that
during this
this scene
the film then
actually an
an innocent
at that point
whole time
the killer's
to poor
had to
to believe
puts the
the timing
way out
in other
other words
meets up with
in two
at once
once during
are also
a ridiculous
film's end
end you
realise that
of an
must have
a nasty
scene to
make it
it look
look like
like he
trying to do
attacked by
to do what
himself on
the head
head with
a bloody
thus the
the revelation
revelation of
the hero
a killer
killer and
and anti
hero in
final scenes
may still
but its
and as a
time the
end credits
credits have
have rolled
end we
we do
learn that
the bizarre
also tries to
flashbacks of
of personal
that have
along but
too is
a problem
the film really
motivations are
say the
i can't think
the least
can't think of
us a
a better
better understanding
much more to
understanding of
to say about
say about the
about the film's
the film's plot
for instance
a teenage
teenage boy
boy and
leave a
it's just a
hotel room
room and
and minutes
a bunch of
minutes later
later we
we see
the girl
off on
we would
would assume
assume the
a little too
it turns
be some
character we
and simple
why you
you may
may ask
do i
i go
go on
on about
the story's
to this movie
because when
when it
it comes
this movie the
comes to
and set
set pieces
most exciting
now has a
scenes in
wandering the
the streets
what they can
a high
and chases
as she
escape from
look a little
from this
a little bit
tense and
and exciting
exciting and
wealth of
of information
alone and
that's exactly
exactly the
the kind
are too many
of thing
the flaws
too often
a whole
are less
less than
the sum
sum of
is a terrible
mind you
you if
you love
if you're looking
you're looking for
worth a
look and
looking for a
for a film
you're a
a fan
fan of
a film about
style of
then it's
what goes on
in the real
in some
the real world
the wonderful
cinematography by
a stylish
great looking
looking and
and quirky
film despite
despite the
at times it
shame because
doesn't have
be that
that way
seem a little
more recent
the aid
aid of
it should be
co writer
a solid
any of
proof that
do it
it if
if he
this film didn't
more than anything
than anything else
and manages to
waste of time
if there's
there's one
thing i
just can't
can't stand
here's a
a note
note to
to all
film makers
films are
more effective
the emotions
for themselves
he discovers that
music is
a serial killer
not a
is on the
good way
with the police
people in
unhappy and
he decides to
decides to take
to take a
the situation
situation is
interest in the
in the case
the case and
my giant
that uses
all is not
is not as
as it seems
with such
such high
i forgot
i watched
watched it
it that
that there
to his character
are other
ways of
of getting
audience members
me was
was that
i wasn't
up or
or even
even the
the slightest
slightest bit
that matter
a forced
contrived and
in all its
has become a
the word
is perhaps the
but i've
perhaps the most
chosen to
use it
it because
to date and
the makers
and there is
there is much
wanted to
to create
create a
a cute
film here
at least two
two or three
a premise
premise that
that might
liked the
in that respect
it down
down with
turns and
of which
needless to say
are intended
intended to
get some
some kind
maybe it
will work
many of the
of the action
some people
people it
the action and
billy crystal
an agent
agent who
who at
they are all
all the more
the kid
actor he
he made
for the fact
the fact that
is doing
that in this
film the
the screenplay
has him
so he
can get
get in
rather than the
a car
accident and
and get
saved by
by an
an enormous
individual who
his name
name is
set design and
and sam
he'd be
great movie
movie star
vision of a
because of
are as
as follows
world and the
a son
son and
a wife
kathleen quinlan
and he's
he's never

for much
of its
its running
in other words
as my
to its
director michael
we are also
who did
did a
great job
directing the
the underrated
by the film's
the film's end
on every

since it
it left
me feeling

by my
is evil
evil and
will ultimately
destroy the
if there's one
one thing i
i just can't
it's a film
a film that
we see the
a note to
off on the
on the back
back of a
is the same
it turns out
out to be
to be some
is not a
not a good
a good way
to tell us
us that the
that the people
the people in
people in the
the film are
and that the
the situation is
is a film
when it comes
film that uses
it comes to
the most exciting
in the world
as i watched
i watched it
that there are
there are other
that i wasn't
or even the
even the slightest
the slightest bit
for that matter
to use it
to create a
it takes a
that might have
might have been
the kind of
i liked the
kind of thing
all of which
films as a
of which are
as a whole
to get some
some kind of
the sum of
and if you're
if you're a
you're a fan
a fan of
who at the
at the beginning
beginning of the
film is in
if you can
in some of
a film the
film despite the
so he can
he can get
a shame because
because it doesn't

you have
is in love
as an
an adult
love with a
with a woman
that are
children who
before the film
the film begins
to go back
go back to
to live
but if
if your
of money and
towards a
saddled with
almost too
great to
to overcome
as a comedy
how a
never truly
it has its
has its moments
in question
question is
making fun of
is like
like any
any other
on the phone
to talk to
the community
community and
and goes
of course his
goes about
about his
much like
like you
you and
and me
but as
as you
beneath the
scary and
and evil
begins to
see that
a mean
but it would
person he
a hard
hard time
control of
and he has
he has a
has a few
gets the
a few good
the better
better of
of him
him he
is quick
some of which
quick to
his actions
actions and
and wants
a gentle
person but
but something
something is
a slew of
a tendency
he also
also has
his only
connection to
love is
is his
his daughter
is kind of
her he
though she
she says
says that
the other hand
she loves
other hand is
loves him
him his
puts his
his relationship
needs to get
to get a
a role that
she tries
to remain
true to
but for
to attach
at least in
themselves to
this kind
of person
in which she
with an
the best thing
to do is
that seems
the town's
police officer
for much of
ticket to
of its running
its running time
man whose
running time is
has just
we can
can see
man that
that is
is both
and living
living with
a prisoner
a great job
a slave
it he
is moving
level of
what kind
man to
the edge
edge of
emotions and
beyond the
of people
with his family
him we
we learn
the answer
answer is
his father
james coburn
character who has
relationship with his
that every
turns out the
afraid to
an iron
his family and
see his
the flashbacks
shown as
the end is
home video
end is a
taken by
but i had
i had a
very effective
had a few
dad is
with it and
it and i
still manages
a grown
man the
the influence
the father
and its
have been a
hard on
the result
result is
is every
it could have
like the
one has
has always
be this
than it is
piece of
drama and
turns in
a strong
strong performance
performance as
to become
as well
well as
he's a
person who
and since it
reduced to
it left me
left me feeling
when in
the presence
presence of
the bitter
but it's
most certainly
saturday night
a simple
there's nothing
simple plan
finding a
about this
that may
and getting
may turn
the cash
away but
is more
more about
worth noting
of greed
greed and
a well
and how
well acted
can become
become the
of your
acting talents
your life
yes there
elements of
that you have
the snow
and cold
although not
as an adult
the blood
blood and
and gore
it shows
shows how
set of
chain of
of events
leading to
to death
death and
the destruction
destruction of
lives and
the day
day the
the things
things that
most are
truth and
and honesty
sense it
making a
movie about
box office
not because
ending but
but because
movie to
end that
way this
this becomes
becomes apparent
the man in
in question is
to cover
the crime
crime the
movie just
here is a
is a man
from there
there the
characters in
like any other
mixture of
simple and
he is a
brothers and
and friends
friends who
who all
prey to
money they
they should
should have
thrown in
like you and
you and me
affected by
beneath the surface
to give
give the
the party
performance of
billy bob
bob thornton
we see that
portrayal of
is a mean
bill paxton
also gives
a hard time
gives a
a powerful
control of his
younger brother
bridget fonda
fonda is
convincing as
him he is
wife who
causes the
a room
room full
and wants to
people and
and several
million dollars
dollars and
and you
you will
will end
end up
he also has
love for
for money
unless you're
you're the
this is not
a simple plan
even though she
she loves him
this is more
his relationship with
relationship with a
with a local
she tries to
of your life
to him and
this kind of
blood and gore
a chain of
chain of events
the destruction of
at the end
of the day
the day the
the things that
to a man
it may seem
a man whose
making a movie
a movie about
movie about the
we can see
can see that
that this is
this is a
because of the
the movie to
after the first
to cover up
cover up the
a level of
the movie just
what kind of
from there the
the characters in
characters in this
the edge of
of people who
we learn that
they should have
the answer is
is the kind
to give the
billy bob thornton
portrayal of the
he is an
performance as the
convincing as the
a room full
room full of
and you will
will end up
end up with
up with a
with a simple
still manages to
it's not a
the 1960s
tv series
the result is
series that
had never
heard of
before this
movie be
be happy
i won't
you with
to be this
with any
lame and
will smith
turns in a
a strong performance
strong performance as
performance as a
as a man
a third
stab at
to become a
as well as
well as a
men in
in black
directed by
same man
this one
when in the
in the presence
can you
the presence of
you say
of his father
the third
west and
artemus gordon
responsible for
the kidnapping
kidnapping of
about this film
this film that
threatening to
take over
within a
is a well
i did
did not
laugh once
this entire
entire picture
you consider
consider that
a part
a bad
bad movie
that's not
movie it's
it's full
very good
good sign
terrible acting
i also
and plot
plot holes
yet it
it remains
remains a
a cult
cult classic
fifteen years
action sequences
years after
sequences which
after its
its release
me with
why this
with little
stands out
out from
from others
few minutes
others with
think back
including the
the original
the lovely
salma hayek
dead is
is extremely
scenes when
it about
about five
part of
stranded in

of nowhere
say that
struggling to
to survive
a variety
variety of
hour of
come on
on i
i saw
saw a
slow the
story line
just like
like that
that on
reminiscent of
and uninvolving
last week
why should
should i
i see
see it
interesting but
very little
inside a
ii is
is different
filled with
it's funny
funny it's
funny to
people die
an anti
anti climactic
are you
pretty much
maybe i
have the
and maybe
of my
sam raimi
impression of
this big
is as
summer blockbuster
well to
such an
or as
they say
say in

in french
execution is
could it
subtle as

not since
oliver stone's
natural born

david cronenberg
the u
so called
him it
willing to
out that
the fine
fine line
line between
in rural
social commentary

have never
the routine
a lack
lack of
of shock
turns into
shock value
alien and
that that
that brings
are fine
fight club
scene and
marks the
pitch black
however his
s the
his efforts
the game
into something
something like
has many
them even
acting as
as both
protagonist is
your typical
the local
in on
right wing
therapy sessions
for everything
everything from
the american
here he
meat loaf
back into
until that
that time
only the
the release
he finds
pay attention
attention to
allows him
to sleep
night at
until a
a fellow
in order
order to
comes along
along to
to ruin
of originality
things for
like many
tv movies
movies it
it creates
monty python
in its
shouldn't be
be on
later he
a soap
a decidedly
outlook on
on life
life one
one night
as his
don't ask
wooden and
with some
actors is
is terrible
a fight
film does
fight and
deal with
doesn't feel
thought provoking
good it
and political
and half
a brief
moment of
in front
front of
makes his
the total
total waste
pale in
in comparison
he moves
the line of
moves into
form the
the titular
dealing with the
with the real
the real life
bond with
and very
very few
rules the
first two
talk about
from the series
the series is
armed with
charisma and
an attractive
the case of
of white
and dead
dead end
who would rather
u s government
into an
dedicated to
the u s
something more
turns out that
and jack
that things
things have
have gone
is after
after this
this point
point when
are plenty
just how
how far
something original
a disappointing
plot twist
on the scene
compared to
that everything
far less
some of them
though not
in the local
and for
a cop
many people
in the american
the early
feel it
be saying
saying that
are good
good for
the soul
the message
like this one
message that
pay attention to
from it
i'll be
surprised if
up here
here and
there and
and i'll
in order to
lack of originality
oliver stone
be on the
is less
less a
a message
movie than
attempt at
at a
a joke
for all
all his
is really
really nothing
nothing more
and far
with some of
of the actors
who constantly
up on
of self
hour and half
context the
the joke
works but
in front of
but like
front of the
the latest
of the screen
people will

a way
way of
the gun
gun on
george lucas

you'll be
despite some
a mediocre
jerry goldsmith
enjoyed the
the overall
for what
to john
was as
john williams
well and
and did
did i
i mention
mention that
movie no
theme and
well i
better suited
suited for
without her
production the
but to
be honest
take up
a step
step in
is generally
in blood
the evolution
try to
all things
the king
is there
can guess
there with
to ensure
course it's
ensure that
it's no
that there's
no secret
there's no
quite a
information on
everyone and
and everything
everything that
that comes
with that
learn a
in mind
great deal
deal more
also like
these types
of guy
movies a
times you
can tell
tell that
the table
a specific
does offer
offer a
story some
he doesn't
doesn't get
twists and
get that
and turns
straight from
notably the
the almost
film by
probably not
by christopher
for everyone
everyone but
who enjoy
guys and
out as
it stands
is written
used to
film when
way through
we hear
through this
hear a
a radio
below the
of light
recommend this
light years
away on
on some
some sort
sort of
or any
won't even
get into
into that
leave your
at home
reveals that
baby and
of that
and everyone
everyone else
needed to
to stand
on its
its own
one to
return to
i really
stuck in
the science
science fiction
the ghetto
films with
points out
neck and
they come
come along
and love
love it
claiming that
that had
had they
and no
original release
release it
hit at
again for
i got
by this
movie i
mean it
it really
a limited
me up
the devil
in disguise
you won't
never before
before seen
won't be
director's cut
cut of
minutes long
falling in
long the
consist of
which don't
so don't
don't be
of note
except for
few moments
moments which
turn away
screen time
with your
during his
whether she
only in
or not
fans of
not and
one question
dog of
is this
i'd never
film it's
i sat
sat down
trust me
me i
released to
did it
it my
then i
way and
smart enough
the heartbreak
it so
so when
that i'd
i'd seen
the dvd
year is
into my
far behind
behind me
down in
has now
had no
no idea
idea what
what to
left the
i knew
knew the
film wasn't
his mind
i never
mind and
never had
had any
any interest
thank you
you very
in it
where's joblo
joblo coming
give it
coming from
a shot
get carter
the impressive
of work
put into
reindeer games
reservoir dogs
was rather
impressed with
opening sequence
sequence which
which made
made me
and wonder
of bad guys
wonder if
however it
was just
the chase
my seat
the nightmare
the lake
i give
give up
i even
film not
not once
and the crew
set up for
three times
times to
up for the
to review
is definitely
definitely a
a terrific
but a
the up and
the following review
following review contains
review contains spoilers
it's just the
bad guy and
the way we
are just a
just a few
a few of
few of the
example of the
rest of this
i know it's
of this movie
as nothing more
that i've seen
a vehicle for
so far this
far this year
this year it's
but i still
i still think
addition to the
the man of
to go around
in terms of
from the opening
through and through
time as the
the residents of
it's not very
it goes on
goes on for
for a little
little too long
more or less
how do you
do you get
you get to
is never explained
the outside world
playing in the
in the background
the background and
these kinds of
the hell out
hell out of
the cast is
is filled with
one day the
they might be
for the most
the most part
most of them
uses it to
the city in
city in the
this film together
the spirit of
to save her
characters to the
the world to
at all the
the box office
from the sky
of course that
here in the
on earth and
the end the
the bottom line
with this movie
the bottom of
i can only
any of this
there is also
because the movie
the movie wants
with a different
at the same
the same time
same time the
in this movie
this movie are
who happens to
happens to be
to be her
and the entire
the entire film
is one thing
for no reason
of course and
to the next
and even a
to put a
no surprise to
that the director
the director of
director of this
at this point
comes from a
a music video
there is some
and i mean
the film however
a small town
for this kind
in search of
is very well
very well done
film is not
it starts off
have all the
a way of
way of the
of one of
when he has
he has to
has to be
in the game
for what it
what it was
for a moment
as well and
did i mention
in the movie
her to be
a lot and
who are the
a pair of
to be honest
her and then
the film which
film which is
covered in blood
with the latter
you can guess
of course it's
that i am
played by peter
fare much better
these types of
best as the
the equivalent of
character from the
from the first
and even though
though the film
to be as
with the right
the right amount
right amount of
twists and turns
and a big
and i'm not
it to the
not a film
a film for
bad guys and
the film on
the first and
version of the
recommend this movie
is presented in
in its original
its original theatrical
or any other
original theatrical aspect
theatrical aspect ratio
aspect ratio of
enhanced for 16x9
for 16x9 televisions
on the disc
a full length
the making of
of a feature
to return to
return to the
from the movie
the movie and
stuck in the
off the screen
the screen and
of time and
can be done
this movie i
i mean it
in all the
all the right
i think you
you won't be
falling in love
is a step
in the right
this film it's
to ensure that
that there's no
a great deal
more about the
about the film
film as a
result of his
you can tell
can tell that
he doesn't get
of his mind
his mind and
most notably the
appearance in the
the film by
where's joblo coming
joblo coming from
role in the
in the original
as it stands
the commercials
the film when
we hear a
looks like
a mild
mild mannered
some sort of
the highlight
instead it
in high
concept is
son is
and everyone else
parents and
on its own
the science fiction
good script
and actors
actors can
can take
the son
take off
the search
as they come
his parents
been in the
would have been
at the box
the previous
new mexico
his real
it's difficult
difficult to
a minute
hundreds of
of scenes
on top
of each
without giving
never before seen
giving you
you a
a chance
chance to
to recover
last one
much away
involves a
a gay
except for a
for a few
a few moments
partner is
while her
husband is
is only in
all done
done in
fans of the
well maybe
maybe not
not exactly
family fare
a grand
ben stiller
down to watch
patricia arquette
tea leoni
when it was
it was released
parade of
of laughs
a more
smart enough to
woody allen
style the
to see it
looks like a
i had no
had no idea
no idea what
what to expect
the film wasn't
but i was
to give it
give it a
put into the
to end the
the concept is
impressed with the
the opening sequence
way the movie
to find out
it was just
a good script
and his wife
back into the
to the end
the film not
is definitely a
end up in
in new mexico
in so
so many
many ways
it's difficult to
ways that
makes you
you wonder
talented and
and high
high profile
get involved
involved in
an embarrassing
on top of
film stars
of each other
sandra bullock
and nicole
nicole kidman
a chance to
long line
from the last
the last one
the start
too much away
their parents
of the better
are still
children and
they go
live with
with their
the present
present day
home and
and meets
a dark
of a woman
her husband is
is in the
in the next
meets and
and falls
falls in
a sweet
man has
has two
two children
and it's all
when her
is hit
done in a
hit by
a truck
and killed
of it
she's not
not too
since she
over it
about two
two minutes
get her
her after
after having
and in
body in
add to
the dead
to mention
light hearted
good idea
idea how
quite sure
sure how
after seeing
film i
best to
there was
was not
even one
writing this
scene or
element that
must admit
admit that
enjoyed it
comedy to
be sure
sure but
but all
by barry
the humor
flat and
wag the
the occasional
dramatic moments
least bit
in retrospect
this has
has less
less to
entertaining in
any way
then to
film itself
to top
top it
we've got
going into
into it
it quite
reviews i
story of

and there are
pretty well
well but
but isn't

do some
the nature
suspension of disbelief
nature and
shots are
many are
what about the
rather bland
a former
would at
produce a
with interesting
to nearly
nearly all
the sequences
sequence in the
we've seen
the film where
start to
to but
just think
to s
however after
a month
of oscar
is the sort
oscar caliber
kind of movie
the sort of
sort of movie
movie like
gives you
from the same
how good
same time and
time and place
were in
that some
do what they
to go with
of the many
an all too
all too familiar
it is it
and the big
it could be
one of two
and you've got
you've got a
by an american
there is something
bad as it
as it could
very good film
so much of
the opportunity to
to act in
in black and
black and white
in one scene
there has been
he and his
has been a
movies and i
and i was
to say but
character in the
the bad guy
days of the
of the war
part of the
in a new
that's what i
the sequel
just happens to
on the same
an average
there must be
must be a
be a movie
but some of
role as
take place in
cop who
was after
the way they
the movie was
fbi agents
but of
been set
he makes
makes a
a run
run for
the group of
for the movie
the movie which
movie which is
follows is
hours of
brought to
the subject matter
us by
he is the
executive decision
is the only
another film
involving a
and the only
and from the
far superior
but even
even on
on it's
it's own
movie while
intelligent and
and had
to root
root for
of the more
mainly because
so little
little about
about him
way into
that he may
gave a
the script doesn't
little time
in there
but they're not
from the film
one of them
the place
the realm of
almost immediately
immediately to
care less
the dialogue is
character gets
little screen
for reasons
it on a
jones is
fine as
as ever
years after the
their respective roles
role is
is hardly
hardly a
a challenge
the sense
it's the
same role
is seemingly
even when he
is easy
easy to
seem to be
last film
film there's
has not
of losing
losing a
a child
the case here
in life
or in
apart from
from that
having said
i will
will also
movie does
isn't given much
the above
is ok
to do some
fbi agent
one gets
the throat
chase and
and sexy
or when
a husband
in and
and out
movie as
you'd think that
think that the
looks as
conjure up
as if
if their
yet another
ordinary people
good time
connected to
the performers
the ocean
performers are
are on
on autopilot
water and
the toilet
a film with
the supporting
supporting cast
not that
cast are
happened in
o k
so what
that's not the
what are
but when
not the case
don't take
take your
children to
falls flat
flat on
alone in
nearly all the
face it
even for
a second
michelle pfeiffer
any better
plot wise
a highly
either the
film starts
wife and
and mother
a trend
a thousand
to capture
is exceptionally
much so
that when
a nervous
break down
down the
a million
million times
times before
a lesbian
cop with
is using
a name
using the
a movie like
makes one
to reach
the ideal
movie my
wasn't the
to mind
it is easy
is easy to
this would
straight to
to video
there's a good
been made
made at
that some of
that may be
and because
having said that
said that i
that i will
this movie does
of the above
apart and
features in
first wife
five years
after their
director is
is all
all right
right but
out it's
and it does
the usual
action movie
the plane
plane crash
fact the only
she's a
child psychologist
lacking in
are nice
especially the
crash and
happened in the
what are the
the ex
suffers from
very bad
haven't seen
of excitement
alone in the
and dumb
in quite
a while
even for a
while i
for a second
i kept
plays the role
giving the
role of a
performers and
one star
for its
and script
and three
not make
three stars
good action
overall rating
is that she
review by
i decided
by david
david wilcock
the difference
and give
provided by
so much so
much so that
two stars
the sequel to
sequel to the
is yet
gets her
type movie
cop with a
movie i'm
not sure
many films
can make a
fatal attraction
comes to mind
a word
his role as
fun is
and therefore
the standard
cannot be
cliches of
like an
word that
that came
came to
right after
the norm
after viewing
that at
no wonder
wonder this
take itself
itself too
like so
movie i've
many other
so to
to hell
hell with
are two
movies i've
can't remember
remember the
those involved
but of course
are up
to something
they're in
living in
a concentration
and when the
and turn
led by
by one
performances which
the ludicrous
comes up
plans for
within the
and always
he makes a
script the
gets caught
day after
day in
a brash
in films
the fence
calling himself
however the
mel gibson
what follows is
promises to
to teach
to fly
to us by
and unbelievable
that after
the viewer
to abandon
accept that
plan for
this movie to
and kills
out what
what sort
without ever
park and
having to
to worry
oscar winning
as though
the wrong
a close
latter two
to leave
were the
is a pretty
second and
scene of
a trilogy
starring the
the delightful
david and
his new
man and
his dog
an incredibly
famous for
for getting
incredibly difficult
themselves into
difficult time
to root for
what made
root for the
their son
uncanny ability
ability to
make an
his inability
inability to
to control
new the
pulled out
out a
because we know
of old
will never
deal of
come and
inspiration to
blows up
way into the
stories but
at people
the hands
hands of
every other
his team
team the
fresh and
the connection
inspired and
connection between
with co
not made
a similar
is easily
run the
is largely
lifted from
watch for
a quick
reference to
and allows
the ball
allows the
woman to
to spend
spend time
providing the
time with
the excitement
thing is
her son
feel like
it's been
and time
be honest i
time again
somewhere else
add up
like nothing
ever done
movie if
a viewer
original idea
idea who
who in
came up
this fact
idea to
then he
war movie
and his character
movie starring
definately not
not like
little screen time
all it's
worth the
can appreciate
their situation
appreciate the
movie for
serious and
them it
is but
probably like
so it's
like it
it much
another thing
better i
that helps
run and
don't mean
mean to
the animators
however that
of giving
his role is
nods to
the very
a memorable
exercise in
in camp
references to
the sense of
chase sequence
inside the
bad it's
it's good
raiders of
the lost
it's the same
lost ark
the same role
indiana jones
jones and
the temple
temple of
of doom
movie isn't
there's even
a nod
nod to
all that
believe it
does have
have its
almost all
the expense
expense of
the psychotic
a couple
film there's a
couple of
of very
there's a few
very subtle
and nick
jabs at
mel gibson's
and film
film history
two actors
history the
a hoot
catch it
it when
audience the
the truly
a funny
written for
is downright
brilliant in
help this
consider this
of last
the larger
portion of
dozens of
blair witch
witch project
every time
on television
the radio
radio and
one or
or two
why because
once you
in and out
and out of
past the
the thought
thought that
that they're
an apartment
the movie as
wishes to
use to
had nothing
nothing to
to offer
no insight
looks as if
were only
the elderly
having a good
only funny
a good time
funny if
you had
had seen
and all the
never the
the supporting cast
the sole
supporting cast are
focus of
of any
any scene
scene if
if you've
you've never
but when it
or how
jones the
about when
sequence is
even if
takes out
out her
in another
gibson is
falls flat on
interesting character
lord and
have her
realize that
that an
not need
need a
a parody
to visit
the film starts
her new
film starts off
visual and
never too
obvious but
enjoyment of
brain dead
movie doesn't
dead in
doesn't require
these movies
knowledge of
got it
the woman
that much
looks at
body and
performances and
film is an
and says
characters they
they play
what was
was it
it's hard
hard not
said to
me at
with every
a million times
every one
but with
a soft
leave her
behind and
your time
known as
up this
girl on
passes for
it she
chemistry with
for humor
humor in
his personal
doesn't necessarily
laugh but
the type
type of
but sweet
suggests the
suspects the
can't believe
some way
way but
watching this
and because of
his limited
this crap
him from
watching it
it they
things out
certainly isn't
isn't any
any help
delivers a
a lovely
that runs
runs away
with most
best one
the director is
and two
is all right
all right but
that seem
relief in
but there's no
in between
have walked
is the usual
even come
an inspired
the movie's
something that's
best scenes
to explain
his lawyer
ex wife
wife is
special effects are
as with
of chicken
comes as
a delightful
surprise the
woman is
film manages
and there's a
to cross
me it
accessible to
both children
funny in
and adults
in context
the animation
animation is
is first
first rate
painfully obvious
remember that
this was
was all
done the
won't reveal
the old
old fashioned
way with
around on
a tiny
this type
guess the
that same
film review
quality that
will say
to detail
has one
as in
the biggest
fare as
in film
toy story
has something
and david
something to
in nearly
own a
every frame
make a good
certainly a
a good action
that becomes
enjoy it
a worthwhile
scenes but
point in
viewers will
it even
after discovering
batman film
chris o'donnell
seen all
across from
all year
i know that
stars in
her family's
this remake
remake of
them that
silent film
you'd be
be pretty
no wonder this
this turkey

doubt that
on tv

that was the
come across
you do
watch it
the manager
manager of
movies i've seen
i've seen in
a pool

in a while
a while i
i can't remember
can't remember the
remember the last
the last time
stupid plot

not sure how
before his
his next
great deal of

in the hands
the hands of

proceeds to
and not the
not the least
it seems like
to track
track down
seems like the
a business
of the standard
movie wasn't
half bad
it wasn't
for a quick
me and
reference to the
to read
that at least
thing is the
left a
a video
like so many
will and
reading the
the ridiculous
part of it
of it is
thought to
to myself
who in the
come to mind
came up with
up with the
as soon
involved in the
soon as
thought it
was quite
as if it
film's final
it is but
the script the
drop the
another thing that
the rating
was going
and most of
to receive
to the very
films of its
down his
his business
references to the
to the great
which i
i felt
was good
good at
after a while
raiders of the
of the lost
the lost ark
women to
indiana jones and
cold hearted
jones and the
there's even a
a nod to
has no
no other
in a little
a career
of playing
at the expense
playing the
the expense of
the goofy
an ad
a couple of
the newspaper
to worry about
that somehow
becomes a

head off
to persuade
the scene of

not like the
it contains
contains the

if you've got
cast and
the movie for

i don't mean
also on
don't mean to
that it's hard
it's hard not
hard not to
every one of
but with a
was even
the gang

known as the
so bad it's
city and
and at
o'donnell is
this movie isn't
isn't all that
was bad
does have its
bad enough
be cut
almost all of
minutes of
in some way
destruction of the

with most of
the best one
that seem to
seem to have

to use to
it comes as
comes as a

that this was
or how about
and you see
to have her
like to be
is this movie
that it's not
when he does
looks at the
the most absurd

has something to
it as a
humor in the

his character and
as in the
that the movie

to fill the
film version of
to me is
it is still
is that i
that i could

at least he
what all the
for us to
get me
a cup
insights into the
cup of

such films

appear to be
the russian mafia
and even that
that is a
an honest
than i was
i was expecting
identical to the
to the original
prove to be
sylvester stallone
prime example
this movie has
in charge
into action
have long
this time the
long since
is just about
just about as
much as i
who tries
scene in the

are plenty of
story opens with
few years
years ago
her role as
that gave
gave him
the roles
roles that
this was the
live up to
up to their
that role
role was
a character as
a broken
but not a
a look at
look at the
an amazing
performance and
it seemed
he had
plays like a
too bad
action but
in the water
the film at
film at least
carter is
he could have
simple story
have been in
in trouble and
in the role
the only saving
only saving grace
saving grace of
grace of the
played with
the music and
and the film
of actor
and after the
the ending credits
tom sizemore
although there are
there are no
gets himself
a drunk
united states and
the music is
is very much
play is
is involved
involved and
and travels
travels to
to set
way he
walks around
dressed like
a lost
what he is
he is doing
really bad
finds out
you'll have a
a much better
michael crichton
has had
some bad
career of
a slimy
of writing
william h macy
fiction the
most profitable
film adaptation
mickey rourke
adaptation of
a multi
novel was
who has been
an adaptation
a michael
else in the
so in
the logic
michael caine
who speaks
film industry
speaks in
be to
while trying
to figure
brother and
afraid that
to extract
revenge on
lot better
little better
than just
novel and
this sounds
like another
that good
is long
cast including
what happens next
samuel l
l jackson
jackson and
sharon stone
but has
has little
and less
is exciting
not tell
several years
asked to
a set
him off
to follow
an alien
the plan
plan he
he wrote
but did
team of
who should
investigate the
the alien
now that
a remake
peter coyote
to study
the british
in length
but is still
production of
the pacific
title role
what with
become an
the team
film seems to
team to
stone and
liev schreiber
together they
travel to
the deep
to understand
one major
old guy
secret is
guy trying
the meaning
meaning of
the huge
of gold
one thing that
taking him
that does not
the heart
heart of
his one
is disappointing
fall flat
tired and
director barry
is at
effects the
problem here
is making
to each other
fiction film
film it
has some
they seem to
to be doing
a bizarre
effects but
it all the
tone to
most intriguing
all the time
the time they
only as
they did not
screen the
words the
to suggest
biggest surprise
than to
show and
and let
let the
actors and
the previous films
the viewer's
carry the
job done
did with
is by
the haunting
that could
a little different
a reasonable
low budget
budget film
actor in
that requires
they are a
to muster
not only are
a boxing
actors to
and simply
simply put
more intelligent than
they don't
attitude towards
than in the
in the past
not getting
getting his
his way
they are also
brings a
feel for
for these
and do
their heads
character he
big bucks
they are not
bucks for
his actors
not really
really get
and why
for what they
the expedition
my book
what they do
a cast
cast of
has great
acting by
fraction of
may be a
and energetic
the price
be a little
car chases
more powerful
like alien
was with
with only
thing it
it lacks
most hollywood
of course in
actors but
but never
this film a
never mind
pay off
off for
mind that
never have
just not
not an
gets a
known as a
has had a
what the hell
many of which
film adaptation of
an adaptation of
that looks like
adaptation of a
so in the
of the bad
the film industry
way to make
film would be
would be to
a big budget
the visual effects
of the s
and i am
view of the
such films as
is probably not
it a little
a little better
it makes a
that is not
is not even
a few times
samuel l jackson
the screen in
and i don't
the musical score
a set of
musical score by
a prime example
prime example of
score for the
a team of
to his credit
who tries to
tries to be
a few years
few years ago
gave him the
dealing with a
the film they
included in the
a long way
if you get
you get a
sharon stone and
very much like
travel to the
i rate it
rate it a
the meaning of
it a on
meaning of the
a on the
on the to
the to scale
but with the
to scale and
scale and a
and a low
a low on
low on the
just look
look back
is a simple
the coen
the heart of
coen brothers
big lebowski
change the
that it does
take away
away the
the bowling
bowling alley
add a
a record
store and
is at his
at his best
high fidelity
or maybe
other way
special effects the
science fiction film
it has some
either way
way it's
been done
but the most
done before
the most intriguing
before a
a trio
trio of
jokes and
complaining about
why is
maybe because
because you
the actors and
actors and the
this you
know these
these guys
carry the film
are and
that could be
laugh at
could be a
at them
them because
because they're

a really bad

no good
hours a
a day
day when
when watching
at someone

strong supporting
still a
taken to

big stars
a letdown
stars and
american pie is

actors that
eugene levy
but they are
best in
talking to
he explains
he chooses
than a movie
a movie theater
something the
the remaining
cast members
physically and
states of
only problem
white and
and years
which makes
have ended
the story itself
instead the
movie goes
heart of the
twenty minutes
his desire
the original i
minutes that
desire to
it was a
that also
a tad
halfway through
by chris
comedy with
at least they
a football
football player
along with the
seann william scott
a comic
they make
comic and
and add
add some
humor as
as directed
in an attempt
an attempt to
and paul
two years ago
the coen brothers
we are left
are left with
the big lebowski
pie and
are nothing more
values are
that the most
the use
when his
been more
more appropriate
the bulk of
it's been done
bulk of the
been done before
is clearly
a trio of
white guy
why is this
does get
some fun
is much better
much better than
to watch is
a poor
these guys are
three of the
a bed
but he's
and you know
to laugh at
to it the
the young
man she
makes you feel
you feel good
believed to
feel good about
good is
trying to be
are pretty
from the original
in the sequel
wasted as
what you are
is poorly
used as
is a shame
and greg
who seems to
seems to know
ally mcbeal
know what he
could not have
is funny but
but it's still
it's still a
well what
as her
her lover
lover and
full monty
thinking when
film because
stealing the
instead i
show in
ended up
she's in
a giant
would come
and eat
film crew
earth is
jennifer lopez
go rent
crew is
to locate
truly be
is the character
jon voight
and become
to relate to
his quest
quest to
capture the
but he is
to simply
wouldn't be
it justice
since the
down to earth
good reason
to avoid
the tale of
picking up
we find
have had
a young black
had some
past but
win over the
now i
i expected
that fact
a key
he spends the
up being
a deadly
ask me
me how
how that
that happens
know and
is put
put out
the person
must get
get back
helps to
to add
man in the
in the united
comes in
in direct
is not only
by himself
about halfway
any event
results in
night at the
the relationship
are either
someone to
you're supposed
to back
he is in
good guys
but you
you really
of his life
because he's
smarter than
in which the
he's just
as dumb
dumb as
as everyone
times i
i almost
found myself
rooting for
to cope with
over the years
stock characters
some reason
in most
movies the
real star
anyway in
the scenes
scenes the
computer generated
decent job
of american pie
american pie and
is thrown
off by
in the history
the history of
example the
catches a
a waterfall
crying out
scene where
a major role
major role in
in his life
his life the
the plot in
production values are
the victim's
of all is
all is the
the use of
the inclusion
inclusion of
a scene
scene early
the in
where we
have been more
the mighty
directly to the
to the camera
to anything
the camera is
witness to
to the fact
showdown with
fact that the
the powerful
were a
when he is
the chance to
as to how
me because
the face
face of
a quarter
quarter of
movie had
plans for a
surrounding the
in the head
audience must
with them
on is
to let
let us
us in
characters don't
of the cast
know about
about and
the danger
the pivotal
pivotal moment
have their
as the young
a case
day of the
of the week
the showdown
saw the
time i
is that he
the benefit
believed to be
benefit of
the doubt
feel sorry for
one was
a bigger
waiting to
make its
thought they
no such
strong supporting cast
there's really
really a
better movie
what are you
it's a movie
movie about a
should have been
this film because
i would have
is about a
he is trying
trying to say
the only problem
only problem with
that it doesn't
the crew is
it should have
the full monty
the movie goes
movie goes on
his quest to
to capture the
is completely wasted
wasted in a
in a brief
is at least
halfway through the
through the movie
this isn't a
don't know what
know what is
is at the
comedy with a
the past but
that seems to
what would
would you
if no
on the big
no one
to play a
one could
could see
see you
you well
well if
a super
look and feel
working for
the military
upon a
a planet
a co
ruled by
is taken
co worker
worker and
some other
humans and
and tries
tries his
across the
get back to
the street
to escape
right of
yeah and
for the plot
the apes
brought about
can talk
about by
despite this
looking like
burton movie
movie or
or its
to commit
seems to get
about halfway through
through the film
kevin bacon
in any event
who plays
signs of
human being
did find
find myself
paul verhoeven
to all the
all the characters
it's hard to
of such
hard to find
although the
the thing
classics as
you're supposed to
that sets
basic instinct
instinct and
the good guys
the infamous
from all
never lets
others is
jobs and
as everyone else
mean i
at times i
was completely
convinced that
rooting for the
every single
was for
features a
for real
a string
string of
also have
among them
doing his best
elisabeth shue
the costumes
for some reason
and kim
kim dickens
waking up
a grade
the morning
plot with
as in most
of special
effects that
don't look
the real star
over them
them for
in most of
than those
of the scenes
hours but
used in
the version
through their
and the effects
a decent job
he gets
characters on
screen as
and looks
i especially
of cheap
who i
for example the
most developed
but otherwise
ape and
and tim
shots and
scene where the
guy who
scenery and
without any
evil in
that we can
effect the
build up
to the film's
the inclusion of
the village
other half
the escape
a scene early
half of
scene early on
the fight
fight scenes
we get to
amounts to
got out
is in a
in a scene
final battle
lost a
my interest
was much
intrigued by
it were a
between the
of human
human beings
them it's
it's as
if that
was about
which just
just seemed
seemed a
you is
the face of
face of the
simply a
a quarter of
quarter of the
the movie had
show some
in films like
who just
just got
on my
man is
my nerves
and didn't
and disturbing
didn't really
really care
not its
way that
the battle
not worth
worth your
ruin it
your hard
it here
here but
hard earned
to show us
thought of
of something
something a
not saying
saying much
much and
and boy
boy is
no but
no one could
was its
lead character
character his
demeanor and
with either
like that the
either one
working for the
ends up being
love interests
when i saw
i saw the
a co worker
co worker and
didn't seem
first time i
give a
give the film
ass about
the benefit of
about anyone
benefit of the
of the doubt
anyone but
across the street
care about
this one was
what happened
was just a
and there was
now i'm
was actually a
sure if
the fault
fault of
actor or
visually the
a better movie
nice to
who plays the
to waste
waste any
any more
the surprise
surprise ending
i'm not going
ending that
planet of
midway through
film back
film and the
tacked on
says i
movie would
despite being
first big
big break
sense to
never been
unless you
you look
monster movie
movie with
at it
a lousy
it from
a suspense
suspense film
is utterly
of view
get in the
a mess
mess the
in the way
does manage
overall i
the way of
i loved
up some
loved the
but only
the planet
planet the
the manner
aware that
manner in
which they
it is all
to pop
pop up
up but
but somehow
film is about
it happens
happens the
difference between
the giant
a string of
in anaconda
but didn't
more realistic
character development
boasts some
why was
effects to
in years
shots of
look as
male and
cringe inducing
were just
at disney
plot with a
world but
with a lot
would still
that truly
of special effects
special effects that
really cool
used in the
for anyone
anyone who
has seen
i cannot
cannot believe
they didn't
in mid
mid air
bring back
done well
when he gets
the lead
digital effects

isn't much of
much of an

with no
and the other
the other half
of their time
who claims
claims to
know how
throw away
his best to
land of
point on
hodgepodge of
all of his
oh yeah and
ripped off
off from
points of
handling of
early in
looking like a
a coma
tim burton movie
a river
virtually the
it's as if
as if that
so why
why did
did they
actor of
of being a
a cameo
cameo appearance
a human being
is simply a
with great
agree to
appear in
of hollywood
hollywood the
most of this
members are
basically just
to happen
a pompous
hired to
the documentary
the thing that
to rise
rise above
cardboard characters
worth your time
your hard earned
an ability
a macho
i mean i
not saying much

as well i
is cast
someone who
of horror
for release
wait for

in the entire
this movie would

calls for
every scene in

crime and
is living
living on
only in the
in the box

punch the
the hill
was much more
special effects to
between the characters

as any of
any of those
is planning
planning to
to break
but it's the
break into
room in
a bank
of the word
bank and
he sends
a bit too
sends his
kind of film
yes to
on my nerves
however if
in mid air
for the way
do whatever
the way that
whatever it
way that the
takes to
turn it
porn star
that they actually
something a little
the movie but
enough about the
to talk about
talk about the
some serious
serious problems
problems in
search of the
lives in the
script that
that should
the actual
either one of
idea why
so important
important to
spend most of
its success
didn't seem to
to give a
no special
are required
who claims to
to know how
know how to
have done
what happened to
is needed
needed for
not sure if
the land of
swimming pool
if this was
the bank
on the film
but the film
points of the
because of it
early in the
by far
in the story
water to
nice to look
for by
by what
was in
in spite
spite of
so why did
title the
is cliched
cliched and
and overly
have seen
a cameo appearance
plot elements
planet of the
of the apes
beast in
in old
to appear in
the law
law and
a robert
type who
up his
all that much
guns and
you look at
look at it
to rise above
one more
point of view
job with
buddy and
i loved the
and sends
a rabid
feel of the
even the most
of the planet
to look like
the manner in
look like a
manner in which
in which they
plot twists
in his eyes
as if he's
was made
a western
but the movie
the villain in
is old
movie and the
and the fact
with a series
the style
style is
is director
director jonathan
but i would
ads for
this film as
his style
including some
you get the
the power of
dream sequences
for anyone who
anyone who has
uses a
who has seen
has seen the
of half
made the film
see one
a person's
believe that they
of the horror
other side
to check out
bring back the
the darkness
there are a
the scene in
a sort
metaphor for
the half
character in this
in this case
of everything
in the meantime
is happening
will have
didn't make
is bound
bound to
the dialog
set the
by someone
experience the
the words
the world in
the quiet
world in which
speaking the
the heavy
an article
accents and
beast is
and familiar
are here
the us
being done
in what
is here
here a
a still
put off by
off by the
the times
times but
genre the
the london
all seems
fact that he's
crime film
and too
too obviously
back then
crime films

i don't want
to go and
like this movie
if there was
there was a
not a great
a part of
a great idea
the plot twists
made for the
because it was
the sci fi
the film has
film has a
a waste of
has a little
it was made
not as a
but as a
film it is
it is an
is an old
up to look
presents us with
us with a
in brief
it shows us
film since
shows us that
this is director
the appeal of
film but he
of fame
but he has
that you can
you can have
of modern
american pop
pop culture
they have a
go see
prepared for
and no one
no one will
does have some
by watching
a moving
teacher who
in a manner
the death
death of
side of a
a scene where
the other side
what she
thought about
a sort of
film was originally
metaphor for the
to die
die for
these characters in
came off
a dumb
review this
film based
everything that is
yeah i
not funny
new movie
ok so
one time
might just
the star
will have a
but other
have a hard
sat in
her latest
when this
be over
and given
of minutes
given a
seemed like
forever in
fact this
this could
time if
let me
a point
point it
it wouldn't
first to
time that
ready to
to rumble
huge disappointment
dream of
movie version
the wcw
an event
and watching
jimmy king
the absolute
hero of
kicked out
in the us
plot thickens
wish to
a choice
rescue the
king and
and put
in what is
are being
by many
are out
get them
wants him
the later
film the plot
a police
officer and
a loser
dialogue as
the help
help of
of david
as what
buck henry
films but it
has written
it would be
and smart
films that
that tries
be funny
but sadly
fails miserably
everything in
match for
the cinematic
wasn't funny
actors are
dull the
plot which
which there
there isn't
a town
of really
really annoying
town called
i give it
how great
great actors
actors like
very funny
a lame
and a on
and directed
concerns the
hollywood is
is ever
and uses
gonna make
how she
doing so
make good
the obstacles
i've always
between her
isn't going
her life
life long
very long
being on
much going
film can
if anything
course one
one big
which isn't
or what
my chair
dull and
i find
matt dillon
it went
went on
to complain
have saved
film from
sex appeal
and money
appeal and
but believe
believe me
me you
you it
reviewed by
for more
our heroine
overcome the
life at
sure how to
film based on
and way
perhaps if
if one
it's not funny
never really
really been
foul mouthed
fond of
actress but
but other than
but she
other than that
shows a
for comedy
comedy in
a black
this picture
her portrayal
time of minutes
the incredibly
shallow and
in fact this
this could be
could be the
femme fatale
chris tucker
in a long
a star
a long time
star making
if not the
con man
she sees
be the first
the first to
and ends
she plays
ready to rumble
than one
one person
a huge disappointment
the ultimate
him when
finally gets
no less
from hell
than three
three people
want him
kicked out of
dead or
alive the
is where the
where the plot
to rescue the
because they are
they are being
her future
the cops
husband and
people who are
cops who
and sister
sister in
out to get
in law
to get them
him of
of murder
know she
wants him to
a police officer
charlie sheen
still be
who has to
with the help
the help of
or whatever
to prove
had just
prove himself
just had
himself a
offers to
removed from
from his
of those films
will just
that tries to
allow him
to be funny
him an
an exclusive
politics and
everything in the
and even the
the actors are
both of
very close
these elements
elements are
are completely
and the plot
the plot which
there isn't much
however and
performance in
as expected
is delivered
expected the
the odd
odd couple
joaquin phoenix
he plays
wind up
teenager who
end which
that i wonder
is another
seeing as
as how
how they
they show
is is
isn't going to
of becoming
of the fact
of success
at any
fact that there
any point
success to
jimmy and
way there
the film if
original or
russell and
portrayed by
affleck and
forgotten about
to be over
gen x
paint by
by numbers
that lacks
lacks any
this film from
any real
film from being
but believe me
a predictable
storyline and
a kid
two dimensional
kid who
dimensional characters
characters make
make money
a reason
going anywhere
save your
family the
a cross
cross country
us believe
world a
theme park
park in
in california
our heads
heads off

wild and
to kill

it's really
really just

i've heard
to define
a blast
against the

of about
about twenty

was too
impressive as
doesn't show

as for
kids the
mind the
fifteen minutes of
seems out
prove that
can play
characters the
being that
them they're
they're so
american pop culture
expect the
the credits
go see it
the odd couple
for this film
yes it's
it's true
true that
isn't even
even close
being as
seeing as how
funny as
the others
which were
fun in
ways but
the death of
other things
of her husband
the way there
first off
in the s
there is just
the national
find any
why but
but maybe
and so many
didn't want
be associated
associated with
film that's
her in the
or just plain
in the new
especially when
the new film
to die for
else the
the company
paint by numbers
be another

john hughes
starting with
a talented
little mermaid
most recently
the lion
lion king
the breakfast
breakfast club
walt disney
proved that
part in the
they could
trains and
looking at
the names
think this
this guy
it wouldn't be
in touch
that now
stands as
well that's
not all
brought us
the home
home alone
series the
the remake
surprise that
big fan
the current
didn't have
behind it
the loss
disappointed with
very obvious
script is
whose only
taking the
is surprisingly
for tv
like one
in broad
would actually
as are
a made
its characters
characters a
sounds like
a wild
of the real
lead by
the nerds
were both
they seemed
new world
i would definitely
fit in
gold with
in well
well on
the fox
a silver
silver screen
major motion
it's quite
the natives
the english
for this movie
with just
he only
only makes
fear and
film even
tv movie
the love
suffered a
in directing
harold ramis
also directed
groundhog day
day as
begins in a
in a town
we had
out is
would go
not entirely
to direct
look who's
talking and
as having
directed the
stereotypes and
and lack
between her and
who went
her and her
the charming
single minded
under his
his belt
the short
short film
appearance is
of course one
to bring
an oscar
oscar nomination
granted that
was his
a blond
feature length
length film
instead we
at heart
bland and
the typical
with a little
heroine who
is practically
isn't anything
and finds
finds the
of cinema
just in
in time
you never
time she
she even
did like
why the
to overcome the
the need
need to
best friend
in her life
us to a
to a new
talking animals
an odd
i have never
it's one
the few
elements that
really work
work the
the animals
a delight
their interactions
brings the
her portrayal of
years later we
better film
if we
we saw
story unfold
eyes the
the talking
a thing
thing for
for john
only other
other character
interest and
the premise is
is basically the
basically the same
the bunch
to take his
delight in
disney films
to las vegas
a let
let down
here with
the exception
exception of
colors of
the wind
of john
singing voice
voice and
of course a
been used
more the
would still be
true for
if he had
too much of
than his
really just a
movie there are
are a couple
which is not
the children
far as i
would be a
they want
for two hours
off like a
wants them
a two hour
to most
this is very
i believe
be disappointed
biggest problem
that disney
disney has
performance in the
fairy tale
a good example
good example of
to change
a movie's
entertainment value
into a movie
doesn't work
though she is
questions in
minds and
have a good
in quality
such is the
is the case
the case with
more obvious
as mentioned
many questions
questions that
me while
viewing the
on the verge
the verge of
was truly
experience with
did he
so quickly
change his
was such
at first i
nice guy
he should
but when the
when the movie
and he makes
makes us believe
us believe that
he made the
this had
and he is
been the
to be quite
white men
can understand
and this movie
the native
as for the
gus van sant
but simply
met a
to prove that
years earlier
there is nothing
is nothing to
the focus of
doesn't give
this movie on
more than just
movie on the
short the
it's true that
for adults
adults and
as funny as
romance and
as the others
not enough
enough action
action or
humor for
in their own
the younger
couple of other
other things that
to get it
they end
on too
many levels
the little mermaid
the fact is
the lion king
the screenplay by
didn't want to
want to be
be associated with
with such a
that they could
especially when you
story is a
in touch with
wanted to see
like the movie
there is another
that as a
as a big
a big fan
big fan of
fan of the
films in the
i was so
the breakfast club
and the result
result is a
looking at the
as a movie
by the evil
movie and he
come to the
to the new
the remake of
the script is
all in all
in all a
made for tv
and it would
a made for
sounds like a
as it turns
on the book
the book by
major motion picture
makes the film
the film even
those rare
me feel
i spent
smith is a
who also directed
spent the
forces of
of nature
is good at
go on to
and waiting
waiting for
the inevitable
a genre
which has
went on to
been taken
taken over
over by
teenagers and
just in time
under his belt
its best
the romance
an oscar nomination
first attempt at
did something
a feature length
feature length film
something which
instead we get
into place
is this is
love story
story about
it's one of
of the few
it certainly
and i know
certainly didn't
didn't look
look that
the outset
ben affleck
of the series
bachelor party
friends and
and family
last night
night of
the need to
of freedom
loves his
his fiancee
the directing
directing debut
and tony
a better film
of everyone
have him
a thoughtful
then on
an ill
latter is
is true
york to
his wedding
the only other
picture with
a free
woman with
is poor
of the bunch
her as
the tagline
delight in the
at every
the rich
begin a
a three
a let down
with the exception
on both
the exception of
exception of the
seeing in
who wants
see them
them both
never taken
an annoying
little film
that serves
slick and
and fast
there's very
gets off
are fun
although their
setting up
have been used
it appears
the situations
appears that
witty dialogue
spent on
ben is
an ideal
sets and
and costumes
role for
is even more
the straight
movie there's
straight laced
straight man
development in
story also
as mr
finding out
part is
really are
and appealing
happened the
than she
half dozen
liv tyler
habit of
in the audience
semblance of
of character
sticks out
was trying
put on
on she
she looks
that they want
are effective
interesting is
effective and
the campy
the script's
to nothing
the biggest problem
makes it
hams it
to enjoy
is suitably
again he
lively and
nothing but
i didn't
a consistent
the predictable
although a
a disappointment
in writing
writing and
a bitter
success in
in acting
acting the
that feels
film certainly
and wonderful
that those
production design
can't save
save a
movie especially
especially a
this mess
a surprisingly
suited to
directing a
isn't about
update of
a period
drama the
developing a
fear of
it's about
place the
the mtv
not what
editing and
and direction
direction are
he thought
happy ending
an ending
ending which
is happy
wasn't just
the choices
no plot
camera angles
make this
have felt
felt like
appeal to
although it's
take on
on more
viewing the film
something fresh
more likely
one too
sloppy and
and occasionally
plot contrivances
a miss
the obligatory
analysis of
up so
as i can
that you'll
if he was
was such a
a nice guy
if it was
is provided
than the movie
the movie would
he should have
direction of
the latter is
loaded with
scenes of
hand held
why not
wants to make
occasionally the
the rich and
works with
world of
of fantasy
far more
more often
who wants to
to see them
can't find
a script
there's very little
smart and
it is i
director but
their characters are
it appears that
film is too
that much of
of the money
faith in
comedy as
as something
sets and costumes
not on the
power to
and not enough
happy to
you expect
a tale
for and
in many ways
and about
some of their
they end up
bit of a
the love interest
find a
out like a
the school's
was trying to
to put on
student who
succeeds in
this film's
to nothing more
interesting premise
this was a
and dark
hams it up
and presents
which has been
of tom
taken over by
is nothing but
nothing but a
add that
a completely
the setup
setup and
that takes
takes all
would be more
bad things
a perfect
perfect example
from the outset
example and
yourself a
a trite
all over the
matter i
over the place
found the
friends and family
and repetitive
and was
gratuitous nudity
if it wasn't
anywhere in
comedy at
to make this
make this film
this one's
it's a great
skip it
from new york
that thing
thing you
new york to
a movie but
first feature
director tom
tom hanks
opposed to
silly and
woman with a
story which
is nowhere
nowhere in
in sight
insult to
to injury
ago it
wasn't until
i say
thing to
to fail
at every turn
entirely to
tape and
and decided
so completely
that even
camp value
to risk
who played
is best
best known
for having
one last
played the
are in
you hear
on tv's
which involves
the bell
parents are
into his
off to a
only way
could make
make such
work was
setting up the
was by
shot at
his childhood
with plenty of
that they are
chased by
who seem
all of their
guys in
high tech
to find a
that if
movies made
made in
in japan
he plays the
behavior and
course there's
no room
are simply
to point
could go
she has been
has been in
have gotten
hill and
mind when
because it is
that's another
with one of
a future
part of a
of a great
that's why
there he
meets an
an assortment
assortment of
of odd
from the start
gallery of
with all
the depth
depth of
pieces of
else that
wait for the
to enjoy the
people but
only wants
wants it
out of this
kill him
right this
chance of
of real
a black comedy
sympathy for
every opportunity
the look
out in the
in from
from other
blade runner
runner and
a perfect example
run down
like they're
leading to a
only really
an extended
depiction of
about a man
kept thinking
it's about a
was more
like what
what some
would think
think it
would look
thought it was
ending which is
for the kids
what went
went wrong
wrong with
screenplay which
guess is
is part
works as
that thing you
thing you do
first feature film
out it
was probably
all downhill
one too many
make fun
is sort
no fun
and they do
it wasn't until
insult to injury
it's one thing
one thing to
is best known
best known for
the character of
that even the
by the bell
scenes of the
in his head
he is given
you are in
are in a
a movie and
you must
must also
a world of
that it could
films and
my favorite
martin scorsese
what it is
kevin smith
that the only
the only way
only way he
he could make
debut with
on in a
who seem to
is that if
that if you
the dreadful
of course there's
this movie for
of that the
i could go
could go on
with the power
the power to
contains some
far the
film yet
which have
bad is
even after
and confused
an assortment of
the cold
cold war
by walter
the novel
novel by
with all the
the depth of
produced by
quentin tarantino
two films
films were
one being
being one
aspect of
of nuclear
nuclear war
war is
lot of people
time but
of people but
but just
just wasn't
wasn't that
side and
good of
it out of
a nuclear
out of his
jackie chan's
entire world
this could have
idea and
but the script
all costs
the theme
theme of
guess that
robert rodriguez
takes place
place during
great director
a brilliant
the look and
one but
and feel of
a cool
of the future
seen an
the soviet
film so
comment on
on them
a combination
them but
combination of
film all
all four
ordered to
set a
after an
now in
all fairness
america the
a commercial
a mechanical
work out
strikes the
of new
contact and
but have
have heard
heard the
depiction of the
scorsese and
work in the
intention of
one which
which was
plot follows
not totally
various characters
characters as
they attempt
to par
i kept thinking
that it was
to you
compelling and
you on
think it would
the reality
simple one
one a
sets in
quickly as
as one
tim roth
who's a
a god
god and
all but
directly from
the fate
couple good
fate of
good moments
lies in
moments is
is working
working on
on new
year's eve
system that
simply because
shift in
the creators
were too
he's the
task to
one there
a no
what went wrong
again and
events in
only has
wrong with this
yet again
anything but
again the
the seemingly
works is
is because
is part of
than what
of the problem
the confines
confines of
its plot
works as a
pulp fiction

if you haven't

see if
then as
on the novel
the novel by

ten times
times in

somewhere in

to hold
hold the
a spunky
and bring
doesn't have a
amusing scene
scene she
read a
a letter
of cash
exactly what
the entire world
what this
the letter
littered with
and perhaps the
at all costs
words and
and scenes
scenes like
the theme of
this work
film made
to scenes
high on
more serious
serious or
takes place during
film was released
most irritating
that but
he realizes
his office
learns that
give this
this a
stars but
his men
centers around a
a combination of
good he
he starts
they knew
it but
they let
let him
then goes
of there
telling him
makes no
no sense
is played
played for
for laughs
long and
it isn't
it tries
back on
the moral
also fails
don't do
where people
do an
an ensemble
shot with
stories and
it with a
and are
supported by
by them
point to
and they're
characters as they
embarrassing to
they attempt to
the writer
are thrown
jump out
working with
crap but
and survive
and the story
everyone involved
cars and
get out
look forward
forward to
in small
to turn the
all though
though is
the cool
from dusk
definition of
dusk till
till dawn
hit man
i suppose
suppose it's
they're more
makes him
seem more
realistic and
the fate of
i seem
lies in the
have one
they aren't
are actually
them from
who make
doesn't make
his big
or interesting
and let's
the events in
let's hope
hope he
good actor
actor and
but the real
presence in
is because it
a silly
certainly has
fact that they
within the confines
the confines of
fun with
character while
has made a
its ability to
war and the
in all of
all of it
itself in
in trying
of this is
the funniest
use of the
of the character
parts are
the numerous
failed attempts
sight gags
gags and
a true
the film's most
and make the
goofy and
of the key
the film he
here you
the importance of
none of which
this if
the difference between
is you
you just
just might
might enjoy
the big hit
first two films
though it is
film for the
being one of
the entirety of
films of all
of all time
is not to
to the screen
and try to
i found the
found the film
on the contrary
way too many
because of its
this is such
is such a
of a film
made this film
he was also
as one of
the same way
so i guess
i guess that
it becomes a
is also a
a great director
all kinds of
it reminded me
reminded me a
of them to
grosse pointe blank
lot of the
in all fairness
the film makers
don't seem to
it is about
how to handle
is about the
to handle the
result is an
is an action
an action film
is a scene
a scene in
be a comedy
that deals with
biggest problem with
problem with the
sort of way
the comedy is
of new york
is out of
is easily the
but it sure
it sure is
is a fascinating
seem a bit
up to par
people of the
with a few
a few other
when it came
lou diamond phillips
the film uses
around in the
a simple one
for a man
and all but
in this one
so far as
far as to
though he has
has a couple
it is very
that if the
new year's eve
on their own
this of course
he's the only
of course is
the only one
he only has
only has a
they decide to
he goes to
when they do
but certainly not
certainly not the
of the big
is that it's
that it's a
painful to watch
to watch the
he is so
something to do
do with a
that he doesn't
that a lot
to bring back
the action sequences
once the film
the film makes
for the same
was supposed to
off and the
the replacement killers
the consequences of
him to get
the only good
only good thing
good thing about
thing about this
two of his
how does one
has nothing to
nothing to do
with the story
help of his
is also very
also very good
very good at
gets in the
like i said
of a couple
what makes it
makes it so
out as a
at least this
who gets to
turns into a
that is as
be the same
on the tv
to see her
to have the
the ending is
that she has
but when i
when i watched
and the two
but as i
from the film's
the film's opening
that should be
be in the
film at all
the most irritating
and it has
it has the
of a high
up to his
might expect from
he learns that
expect from a
for a couple
to watch his
things go wrong
as if they
out of there
the scene is
played for laughs
but it isn't
it isn't funny
who has just
it doesn't quite
is something that
box office hit
his hands and
a comedy it
it tries to
back on the
it was the
a film where
to see if
in a row
to be one
to hold the
of the century
is so much
to come to
lot of money
to do this
part in this
get out of
to realize that
his early
the thing is
it doesn't seem
doesn't seem like
is the film's
present a
he realizes that
a musical
that if he
is totally
unlike any
before its
its time
and the dialogue
with a very
a very long
makes no sense
from our
them together
from the rest
music as
for a while
jesus christ
it's just not
not very good
the rise
rise and
and fall
fall of
of jesus
what he did
a good actor
a dead
comes back
back from
to ask
to them and
to not only
not only the
but to the
to the actors
the famed
wife of
look forward to
her way
top and
and became
to the top
in trying to
she got
be funny the
from dusk till
dusk till dawn
although i
by the actors
i suppose it's
rise to
among other
sight gags and
i seem to
captured the
believe that the
the nation
young age
age of
don't need
of creating
creating an
an international
stir of
not unlike
with few
few exceptions
tend to
be worse

kind of a
i'm not saying
the opening moments
so on and
on and so
dances with wolves
but this movie
we haven't seen
only a few
apart from the
as we see
over by the
movie could have
could have given
the direction is
a script that
it is only
to take her
of a small
it for the
for the screen
you have to
have to go
to go see
see it on
this season
she has to
needs more
lo and
and behold
her in a
the heels
heels of
a while it
to do but
kiss the
the girls
girls and
it looks like
you did
did last
last summer
however the film
and tired
without a doubt
together in a
energy to
each and every
make any
the proceedings
young child
late in
game that
belongs to
where we see
dennis quaid
for quite
have seen it
case but
of interest
keep him
from this point
most recent
takes him
local sheriff
r lee
lee ermey
is torn
torn between
between his
search for
a deeper
deeper meaning
danny glover
for minutes
quirks and
fun but
saves the
jared leto
half is
was my
with i
holding a
a piece
turn out
day i
himself or
i think it
it was because
no dialogue
a silent
he knows
much about
its first
hour the
sound effects
but nobody
movie presents
evidence that
these three
three men
we're given
given little
insight into
who they
are likely
after about
about minutes
fear that
much too
became a
a chore
the proper
reason the
ever got
killer's identity
at its
what he was
pacing and
generation of
of suspense
man behind
scene where he
such classics
plan from
probably because
from outer
outer space
space and
the exact
exact opposite
opposite of
allows us to
his films
stop it
is solid
solid in
they become
a supporting
supporting role
that's more
interesting than
two leads
thrown together
together but
claire danes
object of
of affection
the film shows
tried and
and true
bad it
it stars
billy zane
time director
who wrote
wrote the
a nurse
and die
doesn't know
a mental
mental hospital
do he
hospital and
and proceeds
provides some
stealing a
visuals the
the set
set on
a train
clothes and
a load
looks good
good even
action is
the beautiful
captures the
he falls
turn a
a diamond
finds himself
and when she
a hole
his money
bent on
she was a
his hard
considering how
lo and behold
he stole
the heels of
why didn't
just go
kiss the girls
i know what
know what you
what you did
you did last
did last summer
a list
list of
who were
were at
the mysterious
this character is
to seek
seek out
because he has
he has no
and kill
has no real
them if
to make any
don't have
any of the
of the proceedings
have what
for i
don't think
murder of a
but the two
realized that
late in the
they do in
subject and
do in the
it unfortunately
serves as a
minutes worth
worth of
stretched out
to more
for quite a
while he is
times that
length and
film simply
my attention
attention in
him to a
beginning and
and gradually
the local sheriff
r lee ermey
was already
might seem
be so
off when
the way he
the way it
way it is
unlike most
his direction is
for a reason
films this
a piece of
piece of the
and fails
turn out to
it is and
with lots of
would only
only make
make sense
sense for
so much about
in a sense
scenes which are
been so
at making
half of the
such as the
any of these
scene where she
his script
never know
know but
in either
who they are
a failure
able to make
short and
and pointless
the killer's identity
plays a
a prostitute
the movie starts
consists of
around with
of the acting
there for the
being thrown
thrown out
that are the
the exact opposite
exact opposite of
off a
a cliff
his way through
really that
way through the
for work
by making
in a supporting
a supporting role
more interesting than
interesting than the
the two leads
called upon
upon to
to run
run around
and beat
people up
life is a
tried and true
in the late
to demonstrate
is wrong
first time director
who wrote the
doesn't know what
he knows what
what he wants
look like the
on a train
the action is
twice as
as fast
and the beautiful
i hope
made from
she should be
not enough to
screenplay for
to turn a
and more than
eugene novikov
look at a
pretend to
last movie
they ever
i only
search for a
wish that
not up to
up to the
can turn
and they are
is beyond
beyond me
almost like a
julia roberts
a guilty pleasure
puppy dog
for an hour
while we
the complete
zeta jones
not one
one bit
funny or
uninteresting and
is very good
either of
nothing compared to
is further
movie there is
decided that
does have a
this project
project was
was funny
funny enough
seth green
can i
say i
just don't
so is
worst movie
it's basically
after about minutes
about minutes and
the record
put on a
allow me
to state
few more
to move
move the
it's utterly
it really is
see through
and uninteresting
the man behind
such classics as
sits there
and becomes a
there on
big and
and ugly
from outer space
laugh or
find something
night of the
something in
is amusing
amusing and
hank azaria
shows up
everyone says i
is that his
says i love
offended by
exaggeration of
a stereotype
when an
every now and
now and then
on video
see what
yourself the
there's more
like when
the roof
his arms
story or
stories to
a mental hospital
in how
but everyone
believes that
and proceeds to
the cheap
leave the
the theater
a load of
understand how
a ball
how the
dog that
tales of
the location
the seven
on but
passion and
i do
actors in
and finds himself
actually did
and loves
women are
from time
into their
to time
as their
the leads
film before
the finished
finished product
product of
a dud
past to
the talk
was to
motion pictures
are filled
a fat
fat suit
have lost
presents a
like and
it basically
of seven
looked like
think i'm
i'm gonna
ellen burstyn
again after
smith a
enough with
it the first
my best
best friend's
notting hill
pretty woman
when harry
got mail
been having
a list of
list of the
of the people
of the last
group and
to seek out
daughter the
the project
each of them
of them and
have seen this
seen this movie
they don't have
winona ryder
i don't think
spending the
the summer
summer with
turn into a
and away
decide whether
this would have
would have made
have made a
is beyond me
whether it's
it's better
better to
a friend
a lover
pleasures of
minutes worth of
character who is
is not one
from watching
watching an
an array
array of
of fine
fine performances
performances by
an impressive
ensemble cast
in his own
and kate
the beginning and
overflowing with
talent the
good enough
enough in
funny enough to
basically an
that a film
a film as
i just don't
as this one
can be so
the worst movie
the joy
a dash
dash of
just not funny
and for the
many characters
for the record
so instead
allow me to
a few more
presented with
of its characters
learn about
are told
instead of the
told the
of the other
the reasons
wrong with that
a plot and
and it just
there on the
love of
for you to
has been so
so good at
sum total
total of
is meant
framework for
whether to
forward with
is a failure
all well

great film
featured in
film instead
with my
other is
is based
there was more
flashbacks and
sleeping with
a voice
voice over
over narration
designed to
about any of
day job
the narration
was especially
annoying as
complete lack
it sounded
high school
as opposed
editing the
the core
and i have
story could
comedy or
i have to
a drama
and completely
transformed into
one dimensional
a contrived
war film
hopefully the
she does not
way i
never thought
thought i
an absolute
provide for
an alternate
the first half
and tv
first half hour
i wish
much funnier
about how the
people like
unfortunately it
seem as
and a very
none of this
a drunken
because the film
to complete
leaving us
an outstanding performance
a boring
boring film
and i would
the best scene
that would have
won the
the razzie

new star
the story along
to deal with
alan smithee

be the best
the best work
over the world
the world he
has a nice

the other is
is based on
you expect from
the truth is
i didn't have
didn't have a
could have made
there is the
i find it
the film with
complete lack of
between the two
said that the
voice over narration
as opposed to
this film which
the story the
as much of
much of it
where they are
the way i
but this film
is an absolute
they would have
give this film
us to the
leaving us with
one dimensional characters
that my
my mind
used to be
that yes
yes i
reminds me of
the clich

i've just
just never

to do the

it's unfortunate that
sure the
to visit his

to register

an entertaining
them all to

falls into
many problems
the film may
mostly because
film may be
it can't
decide what

in everything
only wants to

helena bonham carter
it i'm
acting but
other times

is a smart
great in
michael clarke duncan
does he
he really
really need

the words of

his work on

very nice
comes at the
at the very
the very end
his hair
the drama
drama of
in in
a public
well a
things i
its target
a summer movie
was used
or anything
an amusement park
are worth
a chuckle
of good
making his
and a few
a few laughs
possibly could
much he
that kind
lived up to
urban legend
then it
last few
few films
the genre
genre has
has produced
of i
bit where
atmosphere and
and pretty
man which
the disappointing
its share
share of
form a
a cohesive
in store
a kiss
store for
entertaining but
but none
and ultimately
screening of the
rehash of
higher than
the scream
they're just
to say i
to amuse
a hip
and stylish
entertainment but
what will
will probably
become one
best films
jones who
who directed
the far
identity is
the closing
but will
you guessed
because hey
the trailers
only person
be fun
break any
any new
new ground
get a handle
clear and
and present
he was so
mean that
entertainment it
hour or so
i've had
but seems to
really sure
sure what
out of it
in a big
seem so
i saw it
the on
on target
direction by
in the part
i need
tell you
i didn't care
being played by
more frightening
frightening than
his character was
i didn't really
begins with
sequence that
the sole reason
to many of
driving down
a deserted
a gas
stop at
at an
an equally
gas station
films like this
like this are
one problem
you want
you know the
run by
brad dourif
the greatest american
her into
bruce willis and
the credit
credit card
them out of
a phone
the potential
expect it
the creepy
just trying
but i didn't
i didn't think
back seat
seat of
the car
so who
off kilter
scenes and the
the college
and the real
a class
urban legends
the camera work
his resume
yet to see
the day of
of the jackal
the chief
to guess
be of
one you
is anything
anything more
must give
is due
this flick
well in the
what not
not many
courtesy of
the last few
i was in
in store for
rehash of the
not only a
to kill the
become one of
head of the
the best films
best films of
but the plot
hired by a
with the plot
the plot a
for the murder
murder of his
moments of the
co star
the numbers
you guessed it
sean connery
is well
deserving of
the only person
of screen
he walks
to live in
industrial light
light and
and magic
stars a
black hole
believe it or
it or not
a near
not one of
on the case
through his
though he's
not really sure
there's some
a s
who runs
maybe it was
scene has
performances by the
woman in
in peril
a band
that appear
though it was
heavy metal
and believe
it not
don't think i
of king
i need to
to tell you
tell you that
is much more
all together
more frightening than
working with the
with the two
and trying to
begins with a
trying to help
too little
him there are
director rob
me of the
the bruce
problems with the
bruce lee
story has
so much in
one is the
is the biggest
and predictable
predictable and
self important
important and
the list
list goes
the film a
be a big
every character
keep that
or even a
that man
last five
would you want
you want to
every other scene
the computer generated
by the numbers
a problem with
is a surprisingly
minutes of screen
of screen time
that the plot
so many problems
out that the
too bad that
industrial light and
light and magic
just trying to
in the back
the back seat
of the car
it wants to
film about a
trying to find
is it a
for the money
or is it
of both the
that in a
the worst part
the woman in
anything more than
more than it
a band of
and then the
horror films have
supporting characters are
is given a
that of a
capsule the
of a man
who is just
wedding and
will come
it all together
drama a
really need to
but perhaps
perhaps not
not from
colorful and
is almost as
very similar
similar to
the list goes
is set
list goes on
set in
that they have
plot is a
like it was
much a
a family
us it
an excuse
excuse for
on the floor
the floor and
the last five
together the
five minutes of
minutes of this
us what
together and
family members
working in
he's in a
a relationship
major league
surprise i
didn't expect
expect much
that the filmmakers
least of
on cable
proved to
man with
taste for
guaranteed to
he uses
will soon
soon be
of major
ii and
the person who
title is
is of
or both
are people
the lengths
lengths to
to which
director john
has gone
gone to
third movie
movie out
the formula
audiences will
will appreciate
and tom
i did like
clear to
not have been
some of his
typical of
or if
this seems
a particularly
his character as
introduced in
and a couple
the enterprise
that kind of
a sequence where
calls the
the protagonist
film an
around is
life i
and a bit
is hired
has its share
its share of
is having a
to manage
the twins
the buzz
can write
write the
but none of
movie from
from here
finds a
of misfits
who need
together as
team in
into the world
the world of
broken down
you have seen
who directed the
seen it all
made a film
one that is
and pretty much
is supposedly
very similar to
he wasn't
wasn't in
the preceding
is set in
ready for
as much a
of themselves
an excuse for
excuse for a
i wondered
itself to
an nc
nc rating
a match
and at the
time when
guess who
who wins
sex and
and violence
a laugh
violence but
laugh in
is weak
weak and
a relationship with
future the
the folks
room for
for even
threat to
to american
i didn't expect
didn't expect much
the least of
least of which
it when i
of which is
proved to be
as its
is a rather
its subject

told to
reason for
kate winslet
i have ever
have ever seen
ever seen in
a movie the
movie the film
acting is so
school teacher
she and
out of town
on to the
job for
it seemed like
the script and
able to put
the storyline
on the set
least and
are soon
in a number
to point out
birth to
with his friends
turns up
for being so
after awhile
at a bar
married and
film but it
that i can't
that the audience
i can't help
can't help but
help but feel
the complete opposite
period of
for the entire
wait till
theme of the
later on
doesn't look like
one that i
the miserable
can never
never get
get any
i tried to
to keep an
this world
an open mind
while watching it
it but the
and any
enough to watch
he's too
of taking
until their
in a few
ending of
a few days
his best friend
best friend and
i hear
they are just
are just as
novel is
read it
it now
offers a
a beautiful woman
and i believe
i believe that
shows no
society and
be too
to cure
pretend to be
always been
been one
on a date
people's minds
is sure
hell of
it needs
performances from
leads and
a security guard
good supporting
portion of the
of the songs
the songs are
as it goes
bringing a
making him
child like
at other
during the first
half an hour
but very
best actress
actress in
this film should
film should be
age group
don't believe
and sensibility
in the press
of hers
supporting roles
a wonderfully
also pretty good
his bad
parts but
but ultimately
and rachel
is wonderfully
his way into
whom he
moves at
very slow
slow pace
pace and
and keeps
its viewers
film is based
viewers with
save for the
but those
to see him
their films
at times the
i have no
fact that this
i doubt
to be desired
thanks to a
the film ends
about twenty minutes
minutes before the
of the running
his entire life
after watching the
watching the movie
out with a
the movie i
this movie from
from start to
start to finish
reason other than
other than to
than to make
make it a
i felt the
why he was
he was in
film takes place
takes place in
place in the
for such a
well enough to
end it all
of these people
at all to
it tells the
tells the story
the story of
out this
second is
armageddon is
a dull
he gets a
in many respects
is heading
news reporter
for the new
long winded
and robert
by no means
have to do
a space
cup of tea
to blow
the path
there are those
of earth
out there who
expecting a
promise the
with a good
very poor
considered to be
enough time
given any
the hype
any depth
are surprisingly
we never
but when he
of jennifer
them i
david lynch
a crap
the dying
them or
twin peaks
by bruce
and michael
really makes
makes any
masterpiece of
kim basinger
director and
style and
young woman who
really gets
result was
scene which
was extremely
which quickly
well deserved
good performance
own good
good she
she seems
opportunity for
at the local
the pathetic
pathetic attempts
role he
to re
during one
child actors
working today
have his
after she
wakes up
only that
again is
the least and
role like
to prevent
money the
her from
still trying
an impression
takes off
messed up
but surely
surely the
and small
yes and
in wild
heart and
york the
sadly the
the waves
common with
the works
works of
for a very
look too
too good
period of time
and setting
setting is
is light
beautiful but
a wasted
what could
could of
of been
to portray
both characters
people who can
the hours
hours the
directing and
in this world
average movie
the standards
standards of
bit better
good either
is terribly
it is his
has a way
this year the
the second is
the ending of
because it has
was better
it has to
better for
this role
his presence
ending of the
of the novel
the novel is
contributed to
film mostly
mostly by
effort in
couldn't help
who had
had made
best seller
there's no way
leader of a
characters come
of a space
would be too
purpose and
has always been
been one of
and that's what
twist at
unbelievable and
the viewers
viewers who
the stomach
to endure
hell of a
would feel
it needs to
needs to be
the film also
many people will
mess of
two leads and
into the film
be remembered
remembered as
up as the
of a character
a character study
with his new
was the case
of the great
the main problem
main problem is
made in the
at other times
is that there
of her character
her character and
there are too
characters in the
you don't believe
don't believe me
sense and sensibility
we never get
get to know
the result was
in the supporting
or not the
at a very
of the average
during one of
one of such
scene which is
the cast are
this one is
has taken
taken up
he feels
still trying to
movie he
he runs
existence and
a genuinely
this film for
quaid is
has his
eventually they
to call
they work
since he
die and
in common with
the style of
girl to
the dragon
her there
is however
however a
and it becomes
course as
in the scenes
the scenes that
effects are good
know when
when to
itself seriously
call this
new york the
because there
here than
dina meyer
is appealing
appealing as
for this role
really about
team up
so if
but even the
this film the
will not
the film had
laughs that
the boring
parts in
stars as a
man who has
a bit better
add to the
at p
p m
m at
the movie he
he runs into
theater with
and sean
theater rating
battle between the
twist at the
results in a
is becoming
now it
a weekly
movie goers
pay the
mess of a
is the last
an ever
be remembered as
lost in
in space
space is
offering a
will be able
able to get
let's get
get this
over with
with as
element of
as quickly
of science
come to a
fiction but
no time
would not
godzilla is
is without
doubt the
is a nice
film ever
roland emmerich
themselves and
most interesting
film probably
to film
film school
star wars
school to
of course as
written all
year at
as you can
you can probably
the producers
of showing
off their
content and
battle scenes
tension and
hide the
know when to
since we
filmmakers are
the setting
at the right
is it's
it's impossible
about anything
happens in
in essence
the time you
of filmmaking
because there are
family of
of five
crew of
a japanese
considering that
of our
the ship
is attacked
an unseen
personality and
and yet
them seem
jean reno
it the movie
a state
hurt is
the japanese
name of
team up to
without his
so if you
if you are
taken from
this aspect
will play
going to see
course this
is currently
studying the
going to the
other while
movie if you
the necessary
is immediately
problems are
s military

that film's
suffice to
is missing

so does
for mr

realizing that
of potential
potential and
could've been
sentimental and
i noticed
as quickly as
idea behind
the mad
the fantastic
like in
in star

inventive and
a winner
these were
ones the
a technical
to come out
film that has
first part
another good
scene a
read the book
radio station
long time ago
there had
had only
only been
i really do
this that
relied on
it was about
and suspense

is as good
good as the
out of its
film had a
some very funny
the new york
and has a
face to face
to face with

the last minutes
when he was
in s the
he was a
to have some
here as well
as well she

in love and
the film this
a radio station
and how do
my opinion
be easily
for each other
of actors
ralph fiennes
uma thurman
the avengers
months ago
fun at the
i've been
however i
nice to see
noticed that
release date
the mid
dumping ground
then in
million dollar budget
release i
i learned
learned that
late night
was directed
who brought
movie i have
have yet to
my expectations
these things
things the
didn't even
mess i
far the best
it weren't
weren't for
the mere
sets are
empty and
hip hop
like those
those other
films it
feels the
it's like
a bland
have taken
taken the
the easy
easy way
been cut
in at
last name
to close
jackie is
world class
a popular
show on
live in the
the popular
also happens
of mine
in by the
be surprised
artist and
surprised to
and these
come in
an episode
episode i
becomes involved
don't even
an ambitious
to listen to
but judging
plot details
judging from
i've already
less than a
knowing the
just makes
worse i
didn't know
chan films
plot itself
sole purpose
of mr
their roles
on and on
role a
but that would
events that
that do
any time
the film seem
chan in
told me
don't be fooled
of british
james bond
bond and
a chase
thurman is
the performances in
performances in the
lot about
up while
in the face
mother is
which a
while his
his co
in the midst
of blue
the midst of
father is
the equally
the weather
sequences in
a crazy
spectacular as
our heroes
had better
stop him
him or
rumble in
or else
will keep
the characters have
between two
anything as
hell to
film's few
few funny
funny lines
first strike
the energy
out before
make no
heroes are
for fans
swarm of
almost entirely
in english
even so
film is to
don't really
really go
hints at
the bugs
to hollywood
with s
never even
next in
controlled by
rush hour
bad but
his ability to
that film
a mere
many scenes
there is so
will continue
keep your
film that i
your attention
attention from
hong kong
i can't really
i guarantee
thinking about
i realized
do any
any good
good to
has clearly
any film that
many times
happens there
several scenes
has got to
got to be
that didn't
final cut
the influence of
the addition of
is a highly
last scene
particularly bad
that don't
to our
aren't the
suffice to say
of the decade
here one
also happens to
until this
one he
writing and directing
if you've seen
you've seen the
becomes involved in
beauty and
the best parts
here i
don't blame
is that they
this film could
be easy
allen is
the plot itself
plot itself is
most successful
of focus
interest for
in hollywood
matter who
the sole purpose
sole purpose of
less and
the screenwriter
a filmmaker
comedy from
he went
went into
and took
had it
experimenting with
it been
right is
actors for
creative and
of destruction
and intelligent
which this
shouldn't have
after a brief
been given
the task
best film
only two
be but
women as
but here
it mostly
life and
and humor
of experience
experience in
in big
writing the
budget action
choice for
for director
is told
told with
this side
in which a
the sets
to express
life by
and often
set piece
if to
with something
action sequences in
a writer
his books
from these
books and
music score
rumble in the
real story
line and
stuff is
actors playing
lot more
real and
more that
that needs
inspiration for
have liked
liked to
real characters
see these
for not
not giving
giving them
also to
film can be
can be easily
for fans of
by the presence
real person
that sounds
is then
even so the
the voices of
focus and
and can
be seen
a metaphor
and himself
was worth
film will be
will be a
through all
and that it
give us
that it had
portrait of
in the mid
the effort
harry is
set at
old college
not to be
now to
a lifetime
they have been

friends to
one who
him just
why someone

a phony
the blue
hollywood and
if it weren't
it weren't for
weren't for the
with woody
harrelson as
there wasn't
let her
second rate
and the performances
by great
go but
main problem with
is interesting
to speak
speak and
none of it
the fun
it's based
previous film
film while
truth the
ok maybe
maybe it's
elaborate and
quite funny
a journey
some of its
the clutches
clutches of
average person
this is just
who looks
is just plain
looks a
that story
two things
also is
things this
of the popular
even to
is invited
movie actually
to learn that
being made
central character
changes and
who gives
the house
us something
something about
i don't even
which to
care that
that i don't
i don't have
hard rain
judging from the
as seen
the tv show
i didn't know
know and love
the most successful
that american
i was not

a mess of
his life and
the untouchables
all what

he's doing
performance which
fits in
the air
air of

the ever
so many times
cia agent
a metaphor for
for his own
are several scenes
funny movie
the final cut
the issues
hollywood in
in creating
story is told
on we
these problems
by taking
a greater
which makes it
giving the audience
in our
a story that
the last scene
reminds us
us of
can happen
and all of
the premise of
all of this
we never see
to give us
the action scenes
give us a

i like the
a rarity
the best part
to tackle
subject is
there a
supporting cast the
characters are so
among the
we want to
particularly in the
this stuff is
portrayal of a
there's a lot
a lot more
a moral
that needs to

one of my
of my favorite
my favorite actors

out on the

the jokes are
it's up

the ones that
mr freeze

what exactly
exactly is

the fifth
fifth element
however is that
luc besson's
not help
but be
but find
not nearly
as exciting

a wildly
feast for
the senses
best science

the silver
who kills
irony of

she finds
out he's
the basics
he ever

any more than

look is
right from

but soon
well not
soon it
takes her
the clouds
flying through
absolutely breathtaking
to behold
alter ego
especially in
the even
as interesting
ever in
world from
all we
for creating
get up
it over
feel more
ask the
more at
isn't so much
the trio

to beat
them there
whole story
way in which
in which it
no big
virtue of

right the
forgot to mention
things about

make of
however while
most outrageous
who makes
dennis rodman
is that a
almost nothing
dressed in
an animal
sporting a
a blonde
gets some
the shape
shape of
rapid fire
that's it
first this
what do you
do you expect
the act
wears out
out its
very quickly
action sequences and
dialogue to
an unlikely
blend of
keaton is
the quintessential
the tune
val kilmer
of the genre
and fake
score is
george is
he's not
but i'm
next time
sexual encounter
encounter between
a flight
flight attendant
is highly
they'll be
to boot
this sorry
the climax
climax and
visually and
the job
job the
powerful as
time we
begun to
as such
as played
end there
was something
at work
the brains
said about
story and
characters this
me in
by jim
jim carrey
imagine that
a somewhat
sympathetic and
enemy the
the critics
what had
was really
feel bad
bad for
screenplay and
be made
an artistic
luc besson
isn't very
good too
some points
that the film's
he watches
audience into
the sight of
actually looks
to keep a
what exactly is
the fifth element
herself in
in pulp
i could not
hot and
help but be
not nearly as
the lower
same as
but what is
far from a
in batman
these is
if this is
feast for the
for the senses
the best science
best science fiction
scent of
science fiction films
the silver screen
but she's
the one thing
not particularly
particularly good
that has been
film she
saw that
is the most
her lines
weird and
the year a
who knows what
who loved
can also
act for
us who
wes craven
part it
the practice
final product
directors and
and movie
movie stars
like my
they thought
thought was
and story
that brought
director of photography
of 1980s
one it's
nothing and
this decade
right from the
chose to
to the last
the franchise
created by
most popular
beverly hills
comedy that
seven years
he used
used the
star with
with whom
places and
coming to
till the
time however
the charm
it would not
would not have
to wait
years for
the always
fast talking
been with
ends in
a father
father figure
he's also
we also
also get
idea that
he might
bring the
the killers
to justice
that their
their leader
do and
nice touches
such as a
in los
los angeles
goes back
to los
robin and
another subplot
more at home
his old
at home in
only see
a clockwork
clockwork orange
years has
falls apart
five minute
during an
action sequence
different in
the contrast
minutes or
the film while
contrast between
blue collar
serve as
another in
of films
films which
simply doesn't
fed up
time between
this will
for all its
and business
things about the
it like
will die
be a bit
next two
the tone
tone of
do not know
john woo's
in general
and barry
general is
unfortunately this
more as
character of the
like some
little children
the humorous
which turns
great but
the lethal
look for
are sometimes
i watch
make even
but we
minor characters
characters from
film gets
unnecessary and
what this film
there aren't
too much to
as with the
it is also
it's also the
the series and
a flight attendant
knew it was
it's up to
and not very
is a big
success in the
in the climax
the climax and
they should be
should be the
of a big
which the film
the end there
end there is
a sense that
her when she
there was something
with whom he
to be said
be said about
or if you
and has some
watching the film
film with the
first half of
to bring the
to be made
in los angeles
goes back to
to los angeles
all we know
they want to
the original and
example of how
the whole story
things is
that goes
deep end
end with
of the good
violence that
material the
belongs to the
party in
in las
be is
the tone of
tone of the
jon favreau
unfortunately this film
i can't even
cameron diaz
are real
real estate
christian slater
and when i
family man
daniel stern
and drugs
a stripper
by robert
the lethal weapon
a freak
action scenes are
to everyone's
but not too
to prison
her out
the desert
where no
will ever
enters into
the hotel
and sees
sees the
but i'm sure
now you
can forget
forget about
which sets
sets off
get a good
off an
an even
event that
that includes
to make even
there's something
about mary
pulls out
out all
stops to
create something
graphic violence
violence gore
gore and
although the film
of truly
characters that
that all
all get
would probably be
second act
act of
there aren't any
to so
humor but
itself with
a climax
climax that
seen to
be believed
are the only
and inventive
meet joe
joe black
black is
likable character
character to
and cast
cast that
fun i
as played by
people getting
getting their
time it
lee jones and
most boring
gives her
her best
performance to
cinematography and
in playing
for something
who eventually
for half
this time we
we have a
wonder what
claire forlani
doing in
do think
she deserves
three hour
supporting actress
soap opera
dialogue that
death with
lines like
get your
at some points
hopkins who
at how
who lives
balls to
life as
of his wife
man but
but sometimes
he wakes
another character
hears a
original as
makes the most
meets a
most of her
we discover
himself as
a tough
should not
has come
come down
it means
this level
be alive
level that
that very
in pulp fiction
so entertaining
in exchange
as joe
the center
and makes the
center of
there would
pretty much a
about why
joe is
is constantly
his house
house and
perfect and
and managed
the same as
even further
as he was
and joe
in batman forever
her this
relationship is
be fair
some interesting
invited to
family for
for dinner
anything i
and later
is obvious
r rated
story like
very difficult
wouldn't it
and come
would prefer
earth to
good in this
comedy since
worked on
filmmakers were
on making
no holds
holds barred
a serious
and it isn't
it isn't the
the usually
looks great
it his
his talent
talent and
film of the
most difficult
roles of
of recent
in human
not the only
the deep end
only one who
and life
life are
i couldn't help
couldn't help but
suggest that
the material the
is incredibly
a lonely
for those of
those of us
guy that
of us who
he looks
looks and
and acts
but she has
in las vegas
an angel
she has no
of death
others are
he had to
their performances
rescue this
expected from
the final product
seems as
all been
meet joe black
of this year
most of us
time it is
the most boring
was a good
you will have
but after a
and in the
for something to
this one it's
but when you
it there are
there are two
go to the
next to nothing
to the police
nothing in this
and go to
in a film
like this the
in the desert
a three hour
feels like an
of the time
the time it
in a high
there is only
is only one
life as a
he wakes up
see him in
him in a
he meets a
an even more
the idea that
come down to
find out what
what it means
is chosen to
as this film
it does have
the center of
that there's something
there's something about
something about mary
in his house
to be it
out all the
to do and
love with the
love with her
wouldn't be fair
be fair to
in a room
as the scene
the scene where
is invited to
in love the
it is obvious
is obvious that
very funny and
very difficult to
the second act
act of the
of the fun
a clockwork orange
this is another
to be seen
be seen to
seen to be
as a serious
to be believed
that a movie
the film should
and no matter
more than any
fed up with
best performance to
performance to date
how can you
than any of
that's why the
to suggest that
that i really
for his work
the time she
just want to
to death with
more like an
rather than a
him in the
the next two
are not enough
this film had
is not what
from the director
in the picture
the end it
it seems as
seems as if
if they have
more as a
have all been
working on a
should not be
is crap
of his films
american audience

depth and
incapable of

and unsatisfying
and indeed
complex and
movie at
just takes
secret agent
away as
has such
also turns
a joy
joy to
have much
he adds
supporting character
little life
fine and
is perfectly
also making
making an
perfectly cast
it well
picture perfect
especially considering
know for
considering the
a superficial
it never

being an
acting was

a tour
tour de

intriguing and
been as
of fish

he provides
that's a
scenes were

best lines
a mix

long run
larger than

than life
the absurd
human nature
has certainly
is called
for every
rips off
movie where
you believe
that two
was almost
are quite
quite good
other as
see much
him because
earned the
its credit
york is
a higher
just such
although they
are impressive
hope the
keep this
this in
mind if
disappointing and
you're in
the inspiration
the mood
mood for
can't seem
rent the
ending and
has all the
all the necessary
let's just
too hard to
hard to make
look as if
come to an
what looks like
should be a
a non stop
and at some
something like this
it is there
we've seen before
is not so
the acting and
to have an
that her husband
interesting characters and
and that he
up as a
in his first
life to the
gets to play
but it never
he is also
caught in the
is a joy
a joy to
to write a
joy to watch
not the way
is perfectly cast
perfectly cast as
and a bunch
the character development
character development is
or not to
the jokes that
over to the
is more of
a tour de
tour de force
is a mix
a mix of
times in the
larger than life
is an impressive
sense of the
new york is
extremely well and
the potential to
to be better
you see a
see a movie
far too long
a movie where
can't seem to

each other as
let's just hope
are often
he did not

jean luc picard

doubt it

all the major
been there
done that
mention the

the point is
point is that
is that he's
if the rest
a hack
film and is
of the reasons
if you're going
you're going to
to tell a
tell a story
from the beginning
and a new
this is his
but i digress
that made him
made him a
so much and
i haven't even
looks like he's
borders on the
the audience into
film is like
in the cast
story of the
what may be
be a very
zeta jones and
the same kind
same kind of
to know and
spirit of the
but at the
flaw in the
the basic story
highlight of the
for the very
these characters have
a moment of
of what the
instead the film
we're introduced to
obi wan kenobi
the two are
you need to
those who are
referred to as
the other characters
her scenes with
wants to keep
what is going
is going on
and what a
i have a
who could have
has to offer
been a great
of the house
been given a
a much more
their lives and
and the film's
in place of
works in the
the same manner
to do so
in a house
there are so
are so many
so many of
to make one
i would not
just for the
be a part
it is what
gives the movie
for good reason
this type of
but because of
character is the
at the time
takes place at
the promise
the original star
star wars trilogy
scary movie
nowhere near
near as
the discovery of

low brow
of teen

and isn't
not that they
a flawed
and written
written in
film feels
feels as
be somewhat
are about to
we need to
the language
again it
be expected
worth watching
a david
review you
gives a good
going through a
a nervous breakdown
much to the
proof of
want to kill
you take
bad script
script written
for the other
possible to
the size of

but rather the
and provide
he is able
is a rare
20th century
century fox
he was the
was the most
my time
counting the
the film gives
took me
the year old
to indulge in
it fails
it's nice to
catherine zeta
jones plays
the heads of
goes over the
when he finally
tracking down
to like the
you've ever
seen any
really don't
details the
to the fun
to is
that we've
we've all
i'm going
much the
somewhere in the
is funny and
the run
time was
a sub plot
was looking
the prince of
this may
isn't for
what is a
best of all
all the film
they think
a way that
into this
as to the
the real problem
your seat
was that the
that the story
does it so
little of it
of it that
be wrong
wrong the
action that
except for the
present in
which is very
is relatively
is well worth
review you know
involved with
reality is
the actor's
know exactly
role since
and critical
screenplay to
to throw
in plot
scenes seem
what dreams
dreams may
merely as
may come
the action takes
action takes place
so after
six year
jones in
a comedic
actor the
cut it
patch adams
nothing wrong
of will
entered the
the room
knew exactly
mental institution
exactly where
the mask
it's at
the institution
to do battle
talent for
relating to
people he
i'll tell
his attempts
to inject
result in
board the
oscar worthy
in countless
same thing
ving rhames
be told
and though
go a
way toward
ace ventura
the relationships
that means
relationships of
characters at
medical school
even he
an outsider
the depths
depths of
all adds
of friends
adds up
it's easy
sequel that
to describe
describe this
picture one
schindler's list
of dramatic
or lack
never gets
behind a
amid the
the constant
or he
view the
barrage of
vehicle and
this way
good comedy
bob gunton
in particular
times for
to himself
a brain
for days
he do
parody of
feeling of
an emotionally
of this but
looks to
this but i
memorable of
a college
at everything
are a lot
everything it
fails at
doesn't try
and decides
to retire
by and
and large
there may
gain a
entire family
his case
case a
script written by
written by a
tune of
to retrieve
an african
for his role
his role in
a good movie
be done to
to change the
what dreams may
dreams may come
look the
a six year
humor to
you by
20th century fox
of my time
himself to a
i use
a mental institution
it took me
to get to
decline of
of intelligence
he finds that
our culture
may say
his attempts to
that one of
jerry lewis
i q
and look
does have the
characters are well
catherine zeta jones
an oscar worthy
a notch
did an
to be told
a man's
if you've ever
performance for
for when
here he is
it's easy to
it up in
we've all seen
to her and
times before and
this film doesn't
in the big
that the entire
i'm going to
it all adds
as the villain
adds up to
while this may
this may be
think they are
into this film
film is when
edge of your
of your seat
life in a
on screen the
the action that
place in a
for all those
with a brain
of watching this
a parody of
parody of the
of the opening
opening scene of
what's going to
looks to be
being the only
scenes seem to
and decides to
by and large
there may be
to gain a
but more importantly
nothing wrong with
been such
to the tune
the tune of
and last
other side of
i'll tell you
charm that
him such
the lovable
is back
reminder of
ford is
most interesting character
the movie if
film from the
the depths of
and slightly
to describe this
a storm
magazine editor
i use the
at odds
all manner
manner of
first meeting
analyze this
ago i
admit i
it looked
of lame
then when
ford and
as of
he was born
i figured
figured it
be good
theater you
that says
i ever
gave it
unfunny and
me wrong
wrong i
arrival of
top ten
actors of
just out
approach this
this material
mob boss
and drama
naked gun
probably would
songs by
two together
includes the
at others
watch out
but mostly
work it
creates an
that never
i'd like
breaks out
too it
off it
a tedious
script it's
and old
hand at
idea for
a psychiatrist
go anywhere
formula of
big time
bringing the
problem i
forces him
never saw
and much
back as
he always
i'll say
see to
not it's

off to the

me wrong i
in him
just out of
the problem is
desperate attempt

the lines of
the naked gun
with which
probably would have
women in

bit about
the blame for

placed on the
long before the
a good idea
idea for a
for a movie
all manner of
the movie doesn't

most effective
throughout the movie
overall the
as of late
to me in
me in a
characters just
criticism of
him more
is a dead
anyone in the
new one
the arrival of
one if
different from the
if his
leaves him
him she

if you want
you want a
second chance

yet a
perhaps it was
i had seen
a thousand times
enough the
details in
jack nicholson
i had with
characters with
with very
of mind

redeeming qualities
you end
and unfortunately
outside the
the story for
on having
the actors were
with people
people around
like being
in the acting

of course you

jackie chan
walks in
comedy of
is brutally
and sent
and frank
has grown
but let's
let's face
of the month
to jackie
movies for
scenes where
have always
a new age
the garbage
of the little
interesting thing
the risk
value of
dog and
devoted to
necessary to
but neither
little there
a soap opera
who may be
may be that
so often
sure which
are turned
but not enough
turned in
chan is
film especially
any given
especially by
nicholson and
the make
well off
brother is
a genuine
humor is
it's not just
a pleasure
not just a
pleasure to
gags are
case in
in point
his supporting
they fall
are we
he gives
monologue about
display of
and grace
and delivers
an automobile
you actually
take for example
but too
next movie
should just
sequences of
call it
and everybody
go home
comes through
comic performance
by mark
to the main
is clever
touching and
part about
it however
we care
it's not even
let's face it
we can't
out but
mannerisms and
our attention
the scenes where
take care
care of
together in the
simon is
a success
circle of
the movie that
the talent
talent of
get to the
is lacking
the absence
is stuck in
absence of
character makes
seems like it
like it is
leaving his
the plot the
simon and
seen more
film's conclusion
the ads
one actor
be recognized
scream the
the event
by any
they are in
summer is
problem the
an actual
pivotal role
serves to
the make up
and big
barely a
believe he
and visually
an epic
you end up

the joker

the general's
general's daughter

it's rare
see an
put up with

an apparent
him as a

of batman
of course but
that work
work are

campbell is

fact that he

the decision
of sexual
and sent to
sent to the
add the
overwhelmed by
suspect the
director simon
simon west
thinks he's
to convince
images of
two guys
of violence
and huge
stars of
villains and
that's where
he continues
his worst
the dog and
still living

the investigators
stupid to
to recognize
understand that
to last
of evidence
the corner
corner of

fun it's
and pretentious
it provides
or five
a stand
the general's daughter
will probably be
the screen with
what happens when
with her mother
to take care
take care of
like one of
combined with the
is the daughter
however is the
the absence of
which is supposed
batman and the
from the late
if only the
of the dark
director simon west
the film's conclusion
this is that
just can't help
a scene of
hard to believe
a good performance
been told
told by
by several
several people
at each other
one liners and
based on his
resort to
to hand
way you
an action movie
place for
to see an
an action flick
to recognize the
the nature of
directly into
of batman and
some ways
ways the
most of those
brief history
in the rain
the highest
easily the best
most of what
it provides a
to share
but an
at the film's
work and
tim robbins
dead man
just what
one story
confusing and
and filled
so i'll
simply as
possible the
akin to
an intellectual
theater in
produced a
a play
the cradle
of hand
entertain and
or are
between this
what seems
the decision to
just keeps
and characters
we just
he calls
film or
i suspect the
walk out
a friendly
main reason
the outstanding
camera to
the video
me it's
especially if
be interested
the play
orson welles
the garden
film are the
writer of
pleased to
to note
emily watson
his creations
examples of
murray who
joan cusack
ways in
be destroyed
which these
notes that
baker hall
name a
those that
i mentioned
pines for
long lost
who does
who always
although most
were some
his camera
paul thomas
that can't
the already
has it's
and terrifying
to it's
he may have
to maintain the
gets a little
and filled with
and cinematographer
as possible the
story about a
time of the
different story
who do not
what seems like
run out of
don't think so
reveals the
he pays
tribute to
work this
the film or
be a nice
but to me
don't miss
miss it
their roles as
music by
i thought the
the main reason
and make a
minute long
you can do
so stupid
if you were
involved with the
surprising is
course is the
that we are
a disney
children are
target audience
audience of
bill murray who
a place for
taken away
subplot involving a
have their own
their mouths
actually it's
in some ways
to the story
who sees
out of control
singer and
there were some
film goes
it what
whole film is
like this and
they wanted
her on
something we
many of them
of them but
just what the
is sad
with the other
the spice
leonardo dicaprio
party and
he accidentally
a map
a beach
sitting on
commits suicide
of the things
didn't see
his neighbors
one coming
once they
discover a
and saves
about half
two thirds
already the
creation of
changes when
original novel
the cinematography
this part
becoming the
anyone can
is visually
visually stunning
in doing
interpretation of
course there
lacking the
moves along
along at
even this
isn't that
images of the
a turn
turn for
course he
now up
things start
are constantly
becomes almost
ahead of
story it's
video game
whether the
to the audience
be interested in
hoping that
his life to
it one
you go
the dreaded
this don't
than a little
be nothing
to note that
corny and
get go
and seems
do things
a movie it
no apparent
apparent reason
myself included

essentially a
romance with a
ben affleck and
recommend you

it must have
action sequences that
i was surprised

the action the
in last year's
the company of
been able to
review a
a question
manager of the

there is more

sexual situations
very little about

is therefore
is more like
zooms in
save this
an eerie
performances that
running for
can boast
bumps into
boast of
a door
jackson is
the doors
open to
close up
to elicit
that you're
the thriller
about who

a brilliant performance
and julie
julie and
just after
only when
concerning the
the teens
part of her
again a
goes by
and things
are responsible
the terrorist
and outside
the frightening
summer the
coincidence that
a figure
at the moment
been but
me just
to only
add more
minutes to
who knew
about you
arriving at the
happen the
now have
a neat
horror that
all of a
freddie prinze jr
of a sudden
on one of
we all have
what he has
that the characters
meaning to the
the story goes
she is a
is a better
into the ocean
the chemistry between

where is the
four of them
it's too late
had to be
an ounce of
has already been
have been but
what happens in
happens in the
to happen in
about to happen
but i'm not
that i actually
will tell
the audience with
stories that
suspect that
mystery and
the editing
would be fine
be fine for
or she
their mind
their life
life could
killing of
think that it
least she
another world
that's one
i used
away too
because my
a baseball
it's best
best described
baseball bat
andrew niccol
the truman
arquette is

truman show

show is
fantasies and
coming on
to cash
cash in
which actually
cheating on
on each
some genuine
get too
too contrived
it's obvious that
appears at
a staple
of contemporary
like i'm
and relatives
the sun
and sets
save this film
you for
her favorite
herself to
probably know
in david
david lynch's
heart but
have forgotten
a mirror
the killing
fields and
the mission
laura linney
will tell you
dead father
up the film
i suspect that
ed harris
harris who
of water
admit that the
i think i
noah emmerich
who apparently
in a time
are responsible for
that's one of
to balance
to investigate the
hell is
away too much
has very little
plot twists and
is married to
cameras and
harvey keitel
genre of
cheech marin
to cash in
on each other
a love
it's done
yet another of
let you
word on
play and
of gore
gore that
of some of
herself in a
people would
goes out
know they
don't know how
the conventional
films it's
the cult
the sound of
way or
plot involves
what was the
bank robber
might be a
i used to
a killing
have just
hard to see
for so long
have also
taken a
a middle
like last
the truman show
on campus
they kill
kill a
audience as
the store
store clerk
truman show is
the football
eye for
second the
strip club
it says
even remotely
his usual
force behind
and car
down for
he's got
james van
der beek
leads the
a staple of
his newfound
friends and relatives
the effect
died in
atmosphere is
lewis and
design is
which never
get across
get ready
core audience
place is
is open
of tv's
dawson's creek
young and
not much
varsity blues
like about
it either
a vampire
it hasn't
sex to
of the truman
like last year's
place as
the vampires
coming and
clever script
me off
with his wife
spent most
to showcase
not my
characters were
were as
rely on the
james van der
van der beek
of the country
the atmosphere is
love it or
behind the scenes
the high school
to a movie
movie like this
like this is
this is in
to do anything
with the role
there's not much
and there's not
to like about
its way to
one way or
way or another
nicolas cage
out what the
the hell is
credits sequence
the plot involves
gulf war
voice overs
back home
it probably
probably should
go on a
thing about the
cage plays
have known
he got
a paycheck
jerry bruckheimer
a middle aged
of the 90s
even without
his late
everything you
be having
self awareness
board a
goal is
in the name
different but
as simple
measure of
the marketing
i mean the
word on the
a place of
to the entire
notion that
atom egoyan
done something
sweet hereafter
a fatal
school bus
a trailer
of sam
died in a
eerie and
cast with
with too
happened and
john malkovich
opts for

promise of
of restraint
an improvement
truth of
what really
when they get
appeals to
cage is
in a bar
just wants
means of
box of
well for
we finally
later this
perhaps he
three quarters
a stunning
for people
take that
the bus
opening credits sequence
to his wife
were a few
problem so
spent most of
to have to
becomes too
should have known
they first
the characters were
story and the
american films
a recent
saw in the

and death
but first
first he
to be having
a divorce
afraid of
star that
on board a
whose work
is entertaining
just to get
his her
to get out
was always
songs and
a superb
the sweet hereafter
exactly the same
to retain
a realistic
rise of
star as
struggle of
sexuality and
identity as
person on
this planet
is a moment
point but
the promise of
promise of a
the truth of
might have done
are that
the rocky
show or
the elements
where he meets

to sing
to stand out
guess i
the so
his freedom

more than an
i guess i
there was no

a fine job
i just didn't
fine job of
the haunting of
the only character
only character who
the future of

here it is
in a theater
a theater with

that he would
think about the
the best character

course of the
the movie there
there are even
brief moments of
unless they
in the making
to match
it's too bad
non stop action
of director
would call
call the
two movies
released this
flavor of
made you
or bad
our world
once and
credits include
nary a
creativity and
in serious
game in
world on
substance and
call me
of writer
the subplot
subplot about
that ends
the different
and around
to obtain
any sort
through an
same exact
suspects and
movies from
also gets
guise of
worried that
keep me
film unfortunately
great scenes
no problems
it happened
wondering what
break out
remember seeing
sometimes it
seeing a
like her
true i
to cause
know more
missing from
shine in
solely on
and amazing
a climactic
don't expect
the intensity
her breasts
is wasted
mind for
was her
she makes
her limited
limited screen
last of
nomination for
both women
developed characters
aside the
and want
jack and
a funeral
better films
but it certainly
to hang
background to
telling them
is just one
off some
such a great
worried about
the funeral
here's another
death by
for many years
important as
they get the
of attention
for a comedy
credits are
time the film
the film gets
comedy in the
too much like
there's plenty
apart in
my advice
advice to
comes on
taken seriously
of the scene
to carry the
i know this
has just been
the intensity of
the last of
last of the
movie without
of bringing
bringing up
a hole in
is being held
his girl
is fast
some action
scenes i
kids who
have already
already seen
roberts and
and together
have better
her hair
wants to take
they both
the chicago
other to
one case
nora dunn
following a
most of which
a pleasant
change of
of pace
seriously i
of a car
into the theater
the two movies
think that this
is wasted in
but i do
depends on the
plot and the
each other to
like the one
to watch a
watch a film
a film and
change of pace
any sort of
with the material
okay a
for is
everyone in
develops a
the same exact
nothing on
explaining the
into the background
her so
we go
to break out
side to
front and
floating around
to know more
know more about
la femme
femme nikita
own the
have anyone
comedy it is
it is too
is too bad
action flicks
is entirely
you leave
home for
yourself if
limited screen time
my advice to
a bad guy
but one thing
oscar nomination for
is dull
such a film
been made in
and this one
a glimpse
glimpse of
is the devil
solely on the
what a great
charm of the
who think
him and he
mark christopher
business is
the dance
film went
released but
have seen in

go to see
in much

flawed but
is growing
they have no
wife played
to release
release a
struggling with

she discovers
terrific performance
fallen in

he turns to
keep an eye
all the while
trying to keep
to keep his
a job in
no one in

is flawed but
coming a mile
to release a
after a couple
he plays a
has his own
scenes in which
he gets to
by mike myers
a good film
film out of
never been kissed
the supporting players
away from him
as little more

even worse is
how bad this

safe to say
might be the
be the worst
and fresh
you laugh
next few
it on video
the film looks
film maker
at times but
of sci
a gifted

the aliens are
to go out

who looks like
abyss and
about the only
director writer
with the big

explanation is
nearly enough
be trying
a hidden
film contains
the underdog
to concentrate
winning the
his attempt
in toronto
away by
of existence
only things
from getting
working at
to the character
kudos to
characters i've
smooth and
to screen
he dies
talent that
not surprising
is the real
of the funniest
together for
latest film the
really wanted
to spend more
spend more time
all times
a study
in not
movie to be
destruction is
another problem
only by the
be going
after the film
the urge
despite these
these small
the one where
best movies
enough to sustain
treats the
hand with
washed up
by saying that
who also wrote
wrote and directed
the only things
to be trying
girls the
a teen
doesn't care
life the film
a shocking
twist and
his attempt to
and introduces
it's sad
working at the
he almost
some decent
much at
still as
as powerful
are however
round of
and tragic
characters i've seen
interesting as
wasn't as
as the man
maybe he
day is
rooting for him
this situation
annoying and
why did i
and bill
by bill
of trying
plays it
to describe the
throws in
just say that
ship and
really wanted to
at all times
even see
if they're
down the street
that is in
another problem is
this can be
with the camera
the urge to
guy he's
the best movies
best movies of
person to
survive the
film's only
a fighter
and witty
of l
that maybe
bright spots
lets go
laughing the
gives the best
the best performance
play off
aiming for
moves from
visuals are
short on
the amazing
care about them
came out and
slightly less
a very very
title sequence
the number one
a product
help to
at school
everything they
people so
a scream
the bug
wings and
part he
is that in
of trying to
through that
a dismal
most basic
an element
happening to
sex crazed
the elite
still it's
film i've
a b movie
and wit
technology to
most satisfying
to steve
up front
and playing
it's such
anymore and
and none
scenes have
of wit
other with
was in fact
things we
on the second
the film's only
cardboard cut
is still the
film and i
and i love
started out
but it's also
and get a
or that
money at
awful but
of l a
the visuals are
it it seems
steals the film
we get the
of a few
is searching for
by either
john grisham
to fit in
the rights
director with
that another
is evident
is a modern
over as
next to him
promise but
what he's doing
surface of
be part
him are
jackson a
takes a lot
of ted
first contact
what is happening
promise and
exactly what is
right around
film i've ever
left of
of titanic
up from the
perhaps this is
angles and
make things
in anything
the most satisfying
of high school
good it's
it's ironic
ironic that

and none of

a lesser
synopsis a
upon which

was hoping
to accomplish
it of
course it
wrong in
to overlook the

forty five
age to

the dream

stuck in a
dimensional and
too brief
back at the
no nudity
interesting film
a drag
it makes for
makes for a
you thinking
and since the
film could have
not sure what
each of these
exist in the
this film at
a stage play
it of course
of course it
purpose in the
movie is to
and together they
but we see

a showcase
of violent
producing a

excellent film
being john malkovich
refreshing to see

in its own
its own way
pacino is

it puts
in ways

different types
guess that's
anyway if
you enjoy
what happened in
the feeling that
the actress
the dude

a wonderful job
and how much
is a fairly
a host of

big action
rarely seen
if you ask
you ask me
a long story
long story short

into our
left for dead
by his wife
back to life
his share of

the laws
laws of
the frequent

as the first
that anything

as a character
the 19th

so much to
his cell

can't say
is or
can act
we the audience
has that
it's fun
i was still
a really good

be some sort
some guy in

comes off more
who shows
best scene in

doesn't bother
few hundred
money back
worst thing
of his scenes
every scene is
the dialogue and
like she
a great story
film is good
best selling

from a few
a few hundred
the worst thing
which puts
best selling novel
refreshing and

a large part
large part of
his brain
the same in
know in
films where
character or

always the
other directors
the live action

lonely and
end this
its more
thought out
of boogie
however what
the screen for

is all about
and impressive
and is the
in only
anderson is
we see a
be compared to
come from the
a very powerful

searching for the

is a clever
of boogie nights
though there are
with her own
film that does
beginning to the
the ones he
throughout the whole
at all but
on the show
some are
it had a
paul rudd
main characters in
sick of
problem i had
had with the
it this film
girls are
acting of
much screen
earlier in the
that is more
world championship
shows that he
psychological thriller
stay alive
in horror
hoping for
this period
an act
things wrong
songs in

including his
commanding officer
and sophisticated
has lost
heat of
battle and
a bottle
bottle of
no nonsense
maybe if
refuge in
slasher movie
becomes clear
him no
will to
characters like

get behind
film should have
i'll never
theater to
teen age
easier to
they hear
hear that
they're the

and it was
have been for
the girls are
changes the
of them i
doesn't go anywhere
doesn't have much
much screen time
of the reason
reason the film
finally get to
film is so
reflects the
to the party
to eat
deeper into
the minds
minds of
that they don't
is an actor
neil jordan's
to shock
probably the only
movie as well
where to begin
we're all
be taken seriously
i was hoping
to stay alive
songs in the
the movie also
had to do
an act of
has lost his
at the party
a bottle of
success it
for at
this movie that
who had been
make the movie

those are

to compare it

crime is
it's supposed

it's supposed to
last hour
about making
example but
only way to
the movie follows
the last hour
the woods and
to school
can remember
film boasts
five and
