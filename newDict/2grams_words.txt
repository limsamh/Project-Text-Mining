a very
also good
very good
good film
stars as
and easily
as an
the challenge
was an
there's also
mess that
a bit
logic and
bit of
from the
of chemistry
the ground
chemistry between
between them
the slightly
well it's
as the
deja vu
opening scenes
the gay
all over
scenes we
over again
we witness
again as
seems to
as two
to have
have a
in action
films go
a slightly
action as
head to
as he
he and
to head
and his
head in
he's more
more of
played by
this time
by scott
a plot
time unfortunately
scott glenn
unfortunately the
attempt to
than a
to rescue
flick is
a character
is so
a small
so bad
although his
bad that
girl and
his performance
that people
and her
performance is
her dog
is good
his character
from an
away from
just seems
the upcoming
to exist
william forsythe
to help
plays the
the bad
be released
bad guy
guy a
the beginning
beginning of
a mass
of july
come together
together in
of course
who has
course the
in fact
has several
the general
fact the
the scene
million dollars
scene stealer
away to
the audience
audience was
dog who
who is
funnier than
and so
and five
so i
but then
i am
then again
the minority
are always
as i
i was
was when
when i
on screen
the side
side of
cuba gooding
but while
while watching
jerry maguire
smith who
is the
i began
began to
to wonder
wonder how
anyone in
the voice
in their
voice of
could actually
actually like
like this
this film
isn't as
as is
character in
did and
he is
is still
still fun
a little
me to
little but
but not
be completely
not so
so much
honest i
much as
i haven't
as to
haven't had
had this
this little
little fun
smith is
manages to
watching a
to get
good although
a disaster
although she
disaster film
she has
film in
in my
a fairly
when a
entire life
small role
just happens
happens to
up the
body heat
makes an
an appearance
a lot
appearance as
as a
it was
a doctor
was still
but this
the guards
fun to
this is
is primarily
to watch
but since
since there
there must
film and
must be
and every
doesn't just
be a
every scene
just have
scene he's
he's in
is with
with him
human drama
character is
soon the
the now
special effects
though it's
effects and
it's amazing
and a
masquerading as
amazing that
a poorly
that anyone
plot the
the only
him at
who knows
only thing
at all
thing that
that gives
along the
the way
and this
way they
they pick
pick up
the films
up a
a pretty
main problem
gives it
it a
a half
totally unbelievable
is a
called in
in to
would ever
fight the
fifteen minutes
minutes and
and when
and some
when he
she doesn't
some good
good actors
fall in
the group
making the
in love
group of
love with
most of
of their
their characters
naturally the
the film
forces her
begins in
her to
in an
to fall
he discovers
year the
character seems
the year
to go
it in
too quickly
the future
i would
their true
fire in
anyone with
with a
the sky
sky is
character like
is showing
them and
on a
a local
escape and
would be
be able
movie theater
only hope
able to
hope of
to turn
it back
back to
for the
to a
a nice
a line
line of
acting talents
talents are
it would
would take
at night
take a
those of
of say
steven seagal
long time
at the
not by
much longer
the dark
by much
longer than
than this
film would
is mostly
would like
these are
like to
flat and
to make
make out
elijah wood
he's a
a likeable
and sarah
direction is
hero and
and there
leelee sobieski
there are
if a
are some
discovers a
here and
there that
but he
that he
he usually
he may
get better
better the
get an
sends a
the script
script doesn't
doesn't help
a photo
help him
him out
out any
the unknown
he handles
all too
handles the
too often
to an
the comedy
into the
better than
who then
the realm
then is
than the
realm of
is able
unintentionally funny
to determine
ones he
funny the
the dialogue
dialogue is
tends to
pile on
on to
to much
also a
b movie
material and
the plotting
heavily on
co stars
stars are
are a
a mixed
mixed bag
at least
they're all
their respective
respective roles
has the
the scenery
what it
it sets
sets out
out to
cold and
to do
and scott
which is
is to
is always
make the
enjoyable to
feel good
even when
he doesn't
by the
doesn't seem
seem to
end of
his talents
is definitely
definitely the
the case
case here
pretty well
well but
but isn't
isn't given
given much
much more
more to
do some
some of
the nature
nature and
shots are
are interesting
interesting but
many are
rather bland
you'd think
think that
that the
the director
a former
would at
produce a
a film
film with
with interesting
that's not
not the
there's a
a lack
lack of
of originality
to nearly
nearly all
all the
the sequences
we've seen
seen this
this stuff
before it's
it's not
start to
to but
just think
think back
to s
however after
after a
a month
of oscar
oscar caliber
movie like
gives you
on how
the movie
how good
movie the
movie is
those movies
were in
is such
good fun
that some
the running
of them
running time
them are
are still
time passes
a fun
fun movie
movie even
first wife
though it
it may
may be
five years
years after
after their
and certainly
worth seeing
seeing if
just for
not quite
quite as
she's a
a child
pardon the
child psychologist
so that
joke but
but still
that she
she can
the same
same time
parker and
a bunch
bunch of
of people
which despite
despite its
the ex
very bad
bad movie
close to
movie i
haven't seen
seen a
of this
in quite
quite a
a while
while i
i kept
to being
being a
a conventional
giving the
movie director
one star
has returned
for its
returned to
to his
his unique
and three
brand of
three stars
of film
film making
i decided
decided to
the difference
and give
give it
two stars
a romantic
black comedy
comedy about
about love
betrayal and
and self
may not
not be
be the
is yet
yet another
themes to
into a

approach to
i'm not
not sure

sure how
characters and
how many
and their
many films
films have
makes for
for an
an intriguing
fatal attraction
if not
not always
movie it
it seems
it is
seems like
like the
is said
said that
many of
the standard
cliches of
that most
most viewers
love his
the norm
his work
in that
or hate
that at
hate it

it until
doesn't take
take itself
itself too
too seriously
had not
not been
like so
so many
many other
impressed by
are two
by his
his movies
movies i
i found
come to
to mind
those involved
involved in
they're in
in a
and turn
his last
turn in
performances which
effort to
the ludicrous
irritating and
within the
script the
i said
in films
films of
of its
however the
the plot

and unbelievable
that after
to discover
while the
discover that
the viewer
that i
i liked

are several
does not
reasons for
for this
this but
but the
one is
is that

suit and
the type
type of

those who

could probably
guess the
than some
the director's
from this
film review
enough of
but i
i will
his trademark
will say
say that
however to
has one
the biggest
is basically
basically a
a four

that becomes
the character

and that's
that's the
the real
real reason

as great
great as
use his
intelligence and
certain scenes
scenes are
himself and
and doing
identical to
doing his
his own
remember the
the classic
work is
is very
very interesting
just as
as little
he does
to why
why his
performance at

was killed
so as
where they
he learns
more so
types of
so do
of music

a country
him down
down at
where the
they run
is expected
run into
expected to
into each
each other

a great
there's the
just too
although this

what they
they believe
believe to
a dangerous
the prison
yet they

up to
to their
is more
one liners
in any
any kind
kind of
the final
final act
character as
with another
character but
not a
one as
out who
and what's
what's the
the deal
deal with
although we
it plays
plays like
a typical
like a
a desperate
fight scene
scene the
that doesn't
case is
is far
far from
all with
the man
the rest
rest of
has been
film at
along and
and we
he could
realize this
been in
until the
end when
role but
the true
star and
put the
the pieces
only saving
saving grace
grace of
maybe the
scene is
the music
music and
much but
is packed
it still
with it
still has
it even
a believable
and after
atmosphere to
ending credits
although there
are no
of comedy
comedy and
that makes
makes the
the original's
it's all
stand by
the motions
go through
through to
music is
make for
very much
to top
top it
a seemingly
off the
as this
what makes
movie so
if only
more movies
movies like
of time
i think
that any
the human
human race
and steve
are just
just a
any movie
movie could
multitude of
just about
stars that
about every
every turn
make an
the wedding
wedding singer

here is
meaning of
the huge
think the
the guy
guy is
of gold
flat out
can say
the heart
say something
heart of
something that
that just
what is
just isn't
is disappointing
isn't funny
about this
makes me
that it
me laugh
his comedic
performance here
that of
director barry
happy gilmore
is at
his best
he goes
rather than
proves to
me that
effects the
the problem
problem here
is he
is making
own as
making a
a leading
leading man
man in
fiction film
film it
it has
has some
his roles
effects but
roles in
in his
most intriguing
his previous
previous films
he shows
only as
gives him
him a
character that
that for
first time
time he
he actually
screen the
actually has
to fit
fit into
to suggest
as far
far as
than to
show and
and let
let the
the actors
actors and
the viewer's
carry the
does in
have some
did with
the haunting
talents and
that could
could be
a reasonable
just so
perhaps the
a low
low budget
moment is
budget film
is when
film but
but that
he sings
that requires
a song
song for
he claims
manage to
to muster
because he
writing it
it while
actors to
while in
to give
performances and
and simply
it after
simply put
after his
they don't
him this
the part
part that
had me
we do
feel for
a breath
breath of
for these
air and
and do
and while
not get
film like
like all
their heads
takes a
big bucks
bucks for
for his
his actors
and does
towards the
not really
really get
because the
performance and
plot has
and why
to finish
up there
we have
more than
than enough
hilarious moments
moments in
first hour
a minor
make up
up for
the expedition
for any
a cast
during the
cast of
the second
second half
very important
fraction of
the price
but who
who cares
how much
more powerful
are extremely
like alien
was with
with only
the experience
experience is
enjoyable in
these days
to this
this i
i can't
can't imagine
imagine anyone
seeing the
the preview
and not
not wanting
wanting to
see the
actors but
but never
is pointless
pay off
for me
off for
to even
sci fi
written this
review i
i just
just not
just want
not an
to know
know that
i laughed
based on
the result
same name
gets a
name the
the mummy
a on
the to
starts off
to scale
off with
scale and
and on
the high
american pie
pie is
is filled
filled with
laughs but
but they
his mistress
are mostly
by being
way possible
fit for
up having
having his
and being
covered in
i admit
admit to
all while
while still
with everyone
everyone else
still alive
thousand years
years later
this sequel
sequel to

a ton
the obnoxious
ton of
of detail
seann william
william scott
the images
rent a
a summer
especially during
house by
scenes involving
the lake
in order
order to
to attract
cgi the
the computer
an attempt
to score
as usual
such as
the last
but what
what we
we are
moments where
are left
left with
with is
goes after
the people
people who
him after
after all
all those
film attempts
nearly two
way too
too much
much in
young women
women and
in such
and american
such a
a short
is rather
span of
becoming a
of war
most part
for control
are not
not shown
shown as
on one
one hand
hand it
are nothing
nothing more
a fast
fast paced
action film
film on
a frightening
horror film
for it
mena suvari
it to
be successful
spend the
the bulk
bulk of
would have
to focus
focus on
one the
the more
more action
on an
with one
one character
serving as
the comic
having been
been to
that would
to college
problem with
unsure of
of himself
the opposite
three characters
as comic
upon him
including a
one liner
a painful
if they
they were
involving an
were trying
an instant
a horror
action comedy
comedy it
watch is
have helped
a sequence
sequence involving
if it
it were
three of
early on
with two
on in
two young
but unfortunately
whom the
the boys
be impossible
impossible and
offensive and
and plays
then there's
the slapstick
scene between
to generate
between a
a sword
laughs the
film despite
despite some
and an
an army
army of
had an
an innocent
really well
charm to
well done
done it
it the
it had
the sequel
had the
sequel is
the feel
feel of
of slapstick
slapstick comedy
knows what
a chainsaw
chainsaw and
audience members
want and
to them
them the
the many
of darkness
entertaining and
and funny
encounter with
funny it
it feels
becomes a
of place
place but
but at
running gag
least it's
as does
a break
break from
well meaning
playing a
of on
whole the
is pure
from beginning
beginning to
to end
entertaining the
audience but
i must
my review
given some
some new
material is
movie theatre
turn the
the sound
while a
original in
good sound
character with
were almost
i walked
walked out
a pre
the theatre
sound is
that will
is particularly
and will
will make
make you
the box
if you're
though that
you're not
that in
in its
when they
showing the
the trailer
in some
trailer for
who also
of days
penned the
was so
could not
i couldn't
couldn't make
his sights
funny but
but it's
it's still
writer director
still a
as well
well as
a letdown
murder mystery
well what
what are
are you
to expect
than anything
anything else
movie about
by how
about a
that's what
and manages
what i
i should
should have
with in
thinking when
style over
film because
of plot
then i
is somewhat
cult film
instead i
but some
ended up
a giant
would come
come along
and eat
while it's
it's certainly
certainly not
not perfect
repeated viewings
a documentary
film crew
nonetheless a
led by
thriller the
story follows
follows a
visit to
jennifer lopez
the crew
crew is
attempting to
to locate
where he
a lost
discovers that
that a
a serial
serial killer
is on
they find
inspired by
his latest
jon voight
and become
on his
his quest
his back
quest to
back for
to capture
capture the
he decides
to simply
a personal
interest in
case and
the world's
he soon
soon becomes
wouldn't be
drawn into
be doing
doing it
a mystery
it justice
where all
all is
since the
seems the
least two
from a
a fine
if this
performance by
good reason
he brings
to avoid
picking up
charm and
character which
an interesting
to both
the violence
the books
know what
real life
we find
around him
him the
have had
had some
a fascinating
some kind
the past
past but
back the
that seems
facade of
be more
more or
or less
to reveal
now i
i expected
that fact
play a
world where
a key
in all
down the
all its
the line
become a
up being
set up
is perhaps
a deadly
don't ask
ask me
to date
me how
date and
how that
that happens
is much
know and
underneath the
the surface
is put
put out
here it
may take
relegated to
being the
the person
two or
or three
to appreciate
the psychological
must get
get back
play in
that respect
helps to
to add
add a
a sense
since this
comes in
in direct
the full
full length
plan to
version and
fans will
however this
will enjoy
the fact
fact that
needless to
say for
by himself
about halfway
no denying
halfway through
through the
and in
any event
results in
the action
action and
and murder
the relationship
sequences are
are either
of intriguing
are all
more impressive
to all
it's hard
someone to
to root
root for
his scenes
scenes with
you're supposed
supposed to
to back
the good
good guys
but you
and deep
you really
end up
works like
because he's
red and
smarter than
or maybe
set design
design and
he's just
as dumb
dumb as
as everyone
at times
times i
vision of
i almost
found myself
rooting for
world and
mix of
stock characters
the perfect
has much
impression of
much to
to recommend
christopher walken
recommend it
it no
some reason
no question
the back
back of
mind is
the narrative
no matter
some critics
in most
argue that
movies the
doesn't matter
matter in
is supposed
films but
real star
anyway in
all films
the scenes
films to
scenes the
point where
computer generated
the effects
deserve to
to feel
feel cheated
did a
a decent
decent job
way if
of making
making it
you don't
it look
don't want
know the
the solution
solution to
is thrown
off by
by some
some pretty
the next
about an
example the
an hour
hour into
too fast
story takes
takes an
an unexpected
catches a
a guy
off of
a waterfall
crying out
witness the
out loud
murder of
the serial
another scene
scene where
himself by
who we
we see
is none
none other
other than
the author
that we
apparently the
we can
the murders
can see
the victim's
the remainder
remainder of
it's time
time to
to settle
the inclusion
inclusion of
wife he
a scene
is finally
scene early
revealed to
the in
to us
us as
film where
where we
killer in
just how
the mighty
the twist
you see
to anything
are supposed
witness to
into thinking
thinking that
during this
showdown with
this scene
actually an
the powerful
as if
were a
whole time
it so
the killer's
thanks to
to poor
had to
to believe
beyond the
surprised me
me because
because it
it actually
puts the
the timing
the face
face of
way out
in other
before a
other words
a quarter
quarter of
movie had
in two
at once
films like
once during
are also
surrounding the
the monster
a ridiculous
if the
film's end
end you
to something
realise that
an audience
must have
audience must
a nasty
with them
them to
show us
scene to
us the
make it
on is
look like
like he
to let
let us
he was
us in
in on
attacked by
something the
characters don't
know about
about and
and therefore
himself on
the head
head with
a bloody
thus the
the revelation
revelation of
the hero
a killer
killer and
and anti
used to
hero in
the danger
before the
final scenes
the pivotal
pivotal moment
may still
man and
but its
have their
a case
the time
like that
end credits
the showdown
credits have
have rolled
ends up
end we
i saw
saw the
learn that
the bizarre
flashbacks of
time i
of personal
give the
that have
the benefit
benefit of
the doubt
assume that
along but
but there
too is
a problem
motivations are
say the
the least
least the
us a
a better
wasn't the
better understanding
understanding of
this one
one was
was just
there was
actually a
a bigger
waiting to
make its
just when
a teenage
teenage boy
boy and
thought they
leave a
no such
hotel room
room and
and minutes
minutes later
later we
the girl
off on
there's really
really a
better movie
we would
would assume
assume the
and i'm
it turns
turns out
to waste
be some
waste any
any more
character we
on it
midway through
and simple
why you
turns to
may ask
a co
co worker
worker and
do i
i go
says i
go on
on about
the story's
movie would
my first
because when
first big
when it
big break
it comes
comes to
instead it's
and set
turned into
set pieces

have never
never been
most exciting
a monster
monster movie

does manage
up some
but only
only in
as you

but somehow
as she

have gone
by randy
randy quaid
is after
after this
this point
point when
showing up
when you
you are
the wrong
times there
how far
isn't too
will go
plot here
something original
right down
down to
it it's
it's really
a disappointing
really just
plot twist
movie there
a couple
contrived and
couple of
of ways
ways to
to define
compared to
to what
movie which
that everything
i know
far less
a major
though not
for two
and for
a director
coming off
off like
a two
two hour
feels like
a cop
comprised of
of about
about twenty
people in
feel it
be saying
saying that
are good
good for
comes off
the soul
first a
good example
the message
message that
last year's
black sheep
are going
from it
i'll be
surprised if
fast and
up here
there and
and i'll
be even
is generally
is used
it by
or to
the gags
oliver stone
i e
a vegas
is less
less a
a message
such is
movie than
case with
this movie's
attempt at
a joke
for all
all his
and begins
really nothing
and far
the verge
verge of
an affair
affair with
who constantly
a fake
show up
up on
is using
using it
of self
desperate for
for fun
fun and
context the
winds up
the joke
works but
but like
the latest
some people
people will
will get
the simple
get it
fact is
is this
good laugh
and others
funny at
first i
i did
did find
find myself
of little
spoil the
jokes but
but when
of us
my interest
plot a
bad guys
dressed up
up as
well he
he made
character and
during a
be quite
was too
get together
impressive as
together to
the money
money but
movie doesn't
doesn't show
show any
double crosses
as for
goes down
kids the
down and
mind the
the road
who's on
seems out
the up
up and
to prove
and up
prove that
can play
guy and
two characters
characters the
gonna get
courteney cox
few of
the questions
which will
being that
nothing to
them they're
they're so
that i've
expect the
the credits
seen so
so far
to read
far this
this year
year it's
it's got
and it's
of bullets
go around
yes it's
around a
it's true
a definite
true that
isn't even
even close
being as
through and
funny as
and through
the others
which were
were actually
fun in
to high
their own
ways but
the rough
of other
not very
other things
very original
things that
it goes
goes on
on for
little too
first off
too long
long but
the national
the title
find any
who don't
why but
but maybe
is even
got some
didn't want
be associated
shoot out
associated with
with such
scenes one
the coolest
film that's
saying a
especially when
you look
at what
with guns
else the
the company
the king's
playing in
the background
background and
expected this
this to
be another
dialogue and
you would
funny moments
proud to
the cast
cast is
with many
name actors
for reasons
actors as
can guess
they might
might be
be for
they didn't
do their
is another
bit and
here that
well in
an obvious
impact the
onto the
three films
films in
that holds
john hughes
a talented
film together
the spirit
spirit of
himself is
who play
the breakfast
characters to
breakfast club
the t
down this
before but
me with
i guess
that he's
trains and
he's been
of late
he sure
played a
looking at
the names
think this
this guy
here in
everything that
that now
end the
the bottom
stands as
bottom line
line with
is having
having fun
well that's
ass and
not all
and making
all this
making sure
sure there's
brought us
around to
the home
home alone
series the
the remake
remake of
you got
the current
didn't have
behind it
the loss

really great
very obvious
script is
the hands
hands of
have you
whose only
thus far
all at
for tv
tv movies
the violent

like one
violent and

in directing
harold ramis

but instead
instead we
story some
some nice
straight from
twists and
and turns
bland and
loved the
film for
for everyone
everyone but
isn't anything
for those
who enjoy
enjoy the
guys and
of cinema
you never

did like
below the
why the

of that
one to
a thoughtful
return to

there's very
very little
far behind
behind me

left the
are fun
his mind
mind and
foul mouthed
thank you
although their
you very
where's joblo
joblo coming
it appears
coming from
appears that
that much
get carter
spent on
reindeer games
reservoir dogs
sets and
and costumes
the commercials
the five
a mild
mild mannered
movie there's
development in
story also
the highlight
instead it
as mr
finding out
in high
really are
are so
the concept
concept is
happened the
is looking
looking for

liv tyler
good script
the love
love interest
and actors
actors can
can take
sticks out
the son
out like
son and
take off
was quite
the search
accompanied by
on what
a woman
she was
was trying
to put
his parents
put on
on she
she looks
more interesting
after another
interesting is
the previous
the campy
in new
new mexico
to nothing
his real
two dimensional
it's difficult
difficult to
a minute
hundreds of
character he
hams it
it up
on top
top of
is suitably
without giving
giving you
you a
a chance
chance to
but again
to recover
again he
nothing but
last one
but a
a flat
character i
much away
i didn't
the predictable
involves a
a gay
although a
a disappointment
in writing
writing and
success in
in acting
acting the
film certainly
as his
partner is
and wonderful
production design
can't save
while her
save a
husband is
movie especially
especially a
this mess
all done
done in
suited to
directing a
well maybe
maybe not
not exactly

must admit
admit that
a massive

the dog
in retrospect
has less
less to

it wasn't
wasn't just
there's no
going into
into it

i have
camera angles
believe that

although it's
whole way
it didn't
didn't do

they also
is awful
more likely

realized that
this would

been made
but with
it unfortunately
a soft
twenty minutes
minutes worth
worth of

was already
it might
might seem

be so
some way
way but
the surprise
his limited
off when
him from

is i
certainly isn't
isn't any
any help
delivers a
a lovely
unlike most

that runs
runs away
with most

best one
other way

only make
make sense
straight out

so good
at making
they even
even come
an inspired
stab at
something that's
for comedy
comedy in

never know
know but
in either
one might
have expected
a failure
christina ricci

a delightful
surprise the

to cross

and pointless
accessible to
both children
children and
and adults

consists of
the animation
animation is
around with
is first
first rate
remember that
was all
done the
being thrown
thrown out
old fashioned
way with
around on
a tiny
off a
a cliff
really that
for work
by making
that same
quality that
called upon
upon to
to run
run around
to detail
and beat
people up
fare as
makes him
the ultimate
toy story
has something
something to
to demonstrate
in nearly
nearly every

too far
far to

does so
so well
and more
he makes
makes us
feel sorry
sorry for
wondering how
how does
plays his
he came
the strong
back with
strong supporting
supporting cast
consisting of
of big
big stars
nutty professor
stars and
and character
actors that
that really
can come
come back
talking to
back again
here he's
he explains
cast members
straight man
physically and
and given
given little
little to
do the
only problem
with high
are when
he's going
have ended
instead the
movie goes
a far
far cry
cry from
from his
minutes that
you'd expect
that also
completely wasted
wasted in
adept at
it's unfortunate
unfortunate that
ten years
without the
he had
given in
a planet
ruled by
his early
is taken
some other
humans and
and tries
tries his
to escape
oh yeah
yeah and
the apes
can talk
despite this
looking like
tim burton
burton movie
movie or
or its
for kids
human being
if there's
a lesson
film may
although the
the thing
too and
from all
others is
much for
for your
jobs and
screening of
mean i
last night
night and
was completely
convinced that
every single
say i
i wasn't
was for
for real
also have
the costumes
by tom
tom berenger
waking up
is teamed
teamed with
the morning
a hot
hot shot
over them
them for
killed a
hours but
through their
new partner
partner to
out some
characters on
screen as
men in
i especially
only the
who i
played the
believed to
never seemed
most developed
a handle
handle on
ape and
and tim
scenery and
wanted to
evil in
him then
in every
which he
he took
but seems
plot wise
to immediately
it i'm
the blame
build up
the village
the escape
acting but
the fight
all come
fight scenes
but once
got out
out into
great in
final battle
lost a
the jungle
of my
his high
was much
intrigued by
again his
character was
was given
pretty bad
and didn't
human beings
to many
was about
the situations
was very
sequence which
which just
just seemed
seemed a
bit too
was it's
tendency to
the kid
character who
in as
just got
on my
from death
my nerves
didn't really
really care
the battle
ruin it
it here
here but
as possible
g i
greatest american
and of
thought of
of something
something a
no but
was called
them out
far too
too many
was its
now a
lead character
character his
movies are
demeanor and
with either
either one
die hard
much fun
fun the
love interests
didn't seem
some will
give a
action hero
ass about
about anyone
anyone but
didn't think
the nice
care about
what happened
built up
now i'm
the fault
fault of
the actor
actor or
camera work
visually the
very nice
nice to
especially the
surprise ending
ending that
the drama
drama of
planet of
film back
back in
tacked on
and despite
despite being
following the
to its
its target
much sense
was used
sense to
unless you
at it
it from
of view
overall i
i loved
used in
the planet
planet the
the manner
manner in
which they
much he
the humans
real time
then it
but didn't
all in
character development
why was
even in
atmosphere and
and pretty
that its
is pretty
male and
were just
form a
just plain
a cohesive
plain boring
would still
co star
really cool
the numbers
for anyone
anyone who
has seen
i cannot
cannot believe
bring back
sean connery
a surprisingly
is well
world in
which he's
deserving of
of screen
screen time
he walks
a mad
thing the
guy in
be put
put off
surrounded by
industrial light
light and
and magic
the arrival
battlefield earth
stars a
black hole
mission to
to mars
dennis quaid
sleepy hollow
a near
through his
his role
see a
least a
would definitely
though he's
a welcome
oh and
there's some
not likely
a s
is cliched
cliched and
and at
who runs
but also
also pretty
pretty decent
wasn't very
scene has
in seeing
has her
seeing this
playing the
woman in
word of
in peril

was pleasantly
pleasantly surprised
that to
movie wasn't
bad at
it's pretty
run of
a band
the mill
band of
that appear
not something
something i
would say
say is
is merely
heavy metal
watch in
and believe
in case
case you
it not
of king
in it's
when we
all together
pierce brosnan
sum total
the volcano
perhaps more
is determined
