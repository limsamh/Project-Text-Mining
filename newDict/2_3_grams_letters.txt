months later
a bit
bit more
on the
the screen
while we
we all
and never
was released
released the
the first
feel the
first film
has a

the desire
a good
desire to
to blow
and one
word to
the best
head off
to say
disaster films

the latter
when they

seem to
to grasp
logic and
well it's
point of
t v
deja vu
of view
all over
over again
again as
as two

them with
head to
with one
to head
head in
one is
who was

walls of
bit of
of chemistry
a museum
chemistry between
between them
just a
that gives
as the

the gay
a half
seems to
was a
to have
have a
a slightly
at this

finds himself
to go
so that
that the
himself in
the impact
impact of
the middle
middle of
kill off
too quickly
the entire
the biggest
i would
human race
after two
two years
years the
anyone with
the dust
actually it
character like
it would
he ever

much much
much longer
would be
be able
for having
years from
from what
having been
what i
to turn
i understand

the humans
could come
a nice
come back
the surface
and start
start over
over the
the rest
rest of
the plot
take a
plot is
is your
max is
long time
but there
there is

worth mentioning
than this
his and
and only
and her
film would

like to
a very
to make
make out
relationship that
out of
direction is
if a
the final
involving the
the two
two characters
characters is
but he
and emotional
he usually
it's a
for him
a shame
shame that
manages to
him to
that nothing
nothing else
else is
get an
course we
the police
all know
know that
the phone
impact the
at first
he handles
surface the
the title
handles the
the comedy
the previews
better than
show it
than the
it by
by doing
doing this
no tension
ones he
can be
drawn from
tends to
from any
attempt to
to stop
pile on
stop the
on to
to much
because we
that it
it won't
mimi leder
came from
but as
from her
as he
also a
he gets
gets to
to know
episodes of
the hit
television show
he begins
begins to
to sympathize
film debut
was the
and even
the peacemaker
a pathetic
pathetic and
somewhat of
action film
of an
film well
well this
what it
it sets
sets out
him the
the media
to do
however is
is to
creating a
make the
that leaves
a film
leaves the
worse than
feel good
than that
that one
end of
stay away
the movie
as often
movie the
from the
often as
screen or
movie is
or at
at least
least the
the action
action genre
the blame
be placed
placed on
is such
because the
the pace
pace is
co worker
good fun
throughout the
film we
the running
are given
a black
running time
time passes
tell us
us how
how much
much time
time has
security guard
has passed
it goes
becomes one
goes from
the main
hours it
it literally
a fun
feels like
fun movie
time is
movie even
is taking
taking place
place in
in real
though it
real time
time it's
it may
it's that
may be
also involved
involved in
isn't all
all to
and certainly
to blame
blame for
film are
for it
worth seeing
seeing if
and bruce
just for
crafted a
a simplistic
head of
story that
that only
only gets
the news
not quite
gets worse
quite as
what starts
starts out
the station
pardon the
the bad
chock full
full of
joke but
but still
one liners
you know
know you
you are
are going
going to
have more
more sex
than anyone
anyone else
else in
in school
one of the
school and
who uses
and stupid
uses his
you might
might think
think we
we were
power to
back in
to try
the 70s
try and
only one
the subplots
and director of
is remotely
remotely interesting
while the
turn in
and boring
boring and
in fine
returns to the
main plot
to the big
the big screen
that you
you can't
figure out
fine performances
out if
if this
performances that
film is
is supposed
supposed to
be an
an action
drama or
sci fi
to put
put it
it simply
on their
simply the
the special
effects of
acting abilities
are a
then there
a hit
hit and
probably the most
and miss
that's right
who plays
plays the
above the
the earth
the young
are well
well done
on the screen
done and
tv station
ship is
she falls
only to
but the
to become
has a good
become a
a huge
a student
making it
it more
too well
well in
the concept
concept of
the way
of even
way of
trying to
to land
land on
enough but
credits are
but that's
are relatively
is actually
for now
walk on
roles in
give me
in films
me a
a break
films like
and of
the much
sequel to
the crow
well it
it is
is far
far from
last seen in
it makes
independence day
the water
towards the
the land
is effective
effective but
but once
shows that
it hits
hits the
the effects
ability to
water is
is used
to play
used and
it looks
looks so
both good
good girl
that i
i heard
girl and
more laughs
laughs from
fact i
i may
may even
recommend the
hit it off
film for
i wouldn't
for those
those who
wouldn't mind
off in the
who want
want to
to see
seeing her
in the end
see how
how bad
in some
can actually
actually get
some more
these days
good will hunting
just when
when we
we think
visual effects
can't be
comes a
will be
film to
even though the
to show
show that
that they
they really
the outcome is
can and
and should
should be
be one
one thing
thing has
struck a
a wrong
note with
with me
as good as
good as it
which also
as it gets
the actors
loves to
show the
before and
and during
moments of
of terror
reminded me
me of
of another
action director
renny harlin
provides a
a solid
die hard
two hours
hours of
are both
because he
he shows
shows the
actors and
faces of
and seeing
the victims
victims in
them together
together is
likes to
a real
real treat
get away with
their faces
faces but
but instead
away with the
they both
instead of
coming off
off as
do a
a great
seems more
great job
job at
one moment
has an
an astronaut
off into
characters and
into space
this should
be enough
enough to
to warrant
for us
audience but
us to
and shows
care for
shows us
us the
for both
is quite
quite a
of humor
ways to
humor in
an emotional
from an
an audience
a bit of
and without
audience and
and i
without it
i for
for one
it it
of chemistry between
it could've
am not
not going
be fooled
on another
film only
picks up
up its
during the
the last
seems to have
when the
to have a
more likely
pick up
likely to
up and
some very
moments are
are shown
again when
more of a
when you
you watch
of a plot
for their
isn't a
it's obvious
flick that
it will
that will
it's mostly
mostly just
a big
at both
his performance is
the characters
characters but
it didn't
didn't work
work for
for me
and your
me but
your heart
anyway the
just seems to
heart but
actors do
do as
as much
as they
can with
with what
what they
they are
for a
the naked
movie if
truth is
come together in
best of
nothing more
and she
in fact the
more than
is given
given the
the opportunity
opportunity to
her character
is made
the same
same time
time i
presence and
and we
you to
to care
to check
for her
check this
but then again
robert duvall
this one
one out
energetic and
and fun
watch but
but his
is turned
turned into
is not an
comes off
an all too
he still
hasn't had
had many
many good
stick to
are too
to such a
for this
this stuff
is barely
her performance
is only
who is the
enhanced by
is the voice
by her
the voice of
a group of
presence on
he does
does provide
provide some
some nice
is a bit
has been
a bit more
this and
and gives
gives one
his most
performances to
to date
could have
have been
been better
better but
but i
i think
think she
he is still
she just
suffered from
from a
poorly written
character a
a special
off with a
special note
should go
go to
not so much
good in
in his
his role
don't seem to
so much as
role but
as to be
point of view
to me
because she
she was
from tv's
star trek
trek the
she has a
the next
next generation
was one
the highlights
highlights of
very talented
talented cast
this isn't the
impact is
is rated
the case with
rated pg
pg for
elements and
and brief
makes an appearance
the worst
worst films
films of
year and
and if
if it
is any
but this is
of things
things to
to come
this summer
i don't think
could be
luckily the
the x
x files
is coming
coming up
and hopefully
character is so
be more
more successful
that this
film will
will do
do so
because it
it just
just isn't
isn't worth
the walls of
with special
done by
just a few
a few days
and with
a score
and this is
composed by
oscar winner
this is the
james horner
one might
might have
have expected
expected this
this to
more fun
to witness
it's not
not when
hit the
you almost
wish it
it could
could just
just take
take this
along with
with it
fall in love
in love with
love with him
but it doesn't
it doesn't really
much of a
in an effort
an effort to
to fall in
summer movie season
to get his
and it also
came out in
a few months
the first film
first film was
and one of
seems to go
of the best
i had ever
had ever seen
ever seen the
and a group
he loses his
loses his job
his wife and
head to head
he's not a
anyone with a
is so bad
so bad that
would be able
be able to
by the fact
it would take
the fact that
to be released
the beginning of
of course the
than this film
this film would
of the audience
the audience was
would like to
like you and
and so i
you and me
in the minority
as i was
was when i
that he has
he has the
on the side
the side of
to view the
i began to
manages to get
to get an
like this film
out of the
to be completely
better than the
also on the
on the scene
but it was
fun to watch
there's also a
special effects and
effects and a
finds himself in
himself in the
in the middle
the middle of
the only thing
only thing that
middle of the
of the biggest
sets out to
out to do
which is to
is to make
the most of
most of their
to make the
of their characters
make the audience
by the end
the end of
end of the
it in the
of the movie
in the future
the movie the
in the sky
the movie is
movie is a
it back to
the running time
for him to
is a fun
with the police
over the phone
even though it
it may be
is able to
and a good
a few seconds
he gets to
not quite as
killed in a
he begins to
after a
parker and
to investigate a
for him the
up in the
which despite
despite its
close to
to being
a woman who
being a
a conventional
movie director
having an affair
an affair with
affair with a
has returned
returned to
to his
as often as
his unique
brand of
of film
film making
she decides to
a romantic
to use the
black comedy
comedy about
about love
betrayal and
and self
may not
not be
be the
themes to
that she is
a motion
is looking for
motion picture
approach to
in the film
the film that
becomes one of
of the main
makes for
for an
an intriguing
if not
not always
movie it
is said
said that
involved in this
in this film
this film are
to meet the
that most
the president of
most viewers
president of the
of the united
the united states
head of the
love his
his work
or hate
hate it
it until
so they can
it and then
had not
not been
she wants to
impressed by
by his
his movies
movies i
i found
wants to be
his last
irritating and
to try and
for the first
to discover
discover that
i liked
to the public
there are
are several
reasons for
this but
is that
some of
then there is
aspects of
who plays the
characters here
here are
are more
these people are
more like
are the ones
the ones who
real people
people with
go into a
problems the
the story
so that the
story is
the impact of
impact of the
the acting
acting is
is top
to become a
top notch
in short
has created
created a
a world
well in the
world that
in the way
that it's
the way of
it's worth
from what i
hours in
introduces us
come back to
to two
back to the
the rest of
rest of the
of the plot
jonny lee
the plot is
in films like
lee miller
miller is
a cold
but there is
there is one
sequel to the
his young
young wife
that she has
her part
the two characters
obsessed with
having a
a baby
she never
it's a shame
a shame that
attempts to
to interact
interact with
with her
her husband
of course we
we all know
all know that
know that the
a human
interested in
in is
it and the
when she's
after he
he refuses
refuses to
will be able
to find
find someone
someone else
else to
play the
to stop the
the role
role of
the other
nick nolte
nolte and
episodes of the
are an
an older
but they're
no more
a mysterious
their past
two hours of
stay away from
away from the
a matter
matter of
or at least
at least the
but since
much of the
of the blame
be placed on
lucky to
is a real
to touch
a real treat
they have
have an
the pace is
throughout the film
a great job
the film we
he can
film we are
we are given
around as
he wants
that no
bond is
is established
a result
for us to
result of
of these
of emotional
them is
is quite a
is palpable
to blame for
quite a bit
the four
of humor in
humor in this
this film and
what starts out
to fix
for the audience
the inside
inside of
the apartment
chock full of
more likely to
shares with
are going to
going to have
two of
to have more
from the audience
of them
them are
anyone else in
attracted to
to one
one another
this isn't a
another and
you might think
doesn't take
take long
long before
in her
back in the
only one of
captivated by
runs into
while the rest
a hotel
the main plot
plot is so
that you can't
to accompany
if this film
him on
this film is
nothing more than
is supposed to
more than the
a weekend
supposed to be
to be an
the opportunity to
the mountains
the romantic
to put it
the special effects
characters are
are interesting
of this film
at the same
interesting in
the same time
in that
hit and miss
of love
this one out
something different
well done and
to everyone
everyone to
i wanted
wanted to
it's an
to like
is a huge
film as
i went
loss of
went into
of control
into it
it the
the concept of
the more
a means
means to
i left
end to
through all
all the
the usual
lines of
if you
on the surface
out his
you liked
you'll love
and to
wild things
and of course
method of
gives a
a stunning
performance this
well it is
it is far
is far from
will have
have you
none of
and it makes
these characters
for days
appears to
oh yeah
to love
yeah the
the day
day a
they love
these is
themselves the
the greatest
neve campbell
greatest strength
strength of
falls in
film lies
not in
and it looks
more serious
the script
script but
stuff and
but in
the performances
film i
i mean
mean that
that in
is perfect
in fact i
in nearly
perfect as
the film for
film for those
suit and
for those who
and tie
who want to
want to see
single handedly
to see how
broken down
down the
the rules
him as
surrounding the
will find
find that
is almost
a film to
here as
r rating
to show that
the image
image of
the mpaa
and should be
i'm not
not saying
saying that
a bad
way but
you see
see this
film you
you may
is delightful
delightful as
by what
to show the
what you
and he
perhaps the
he manages
to deliver
reminded me of
the film's
cast and
lines with
plot that
ease the
they let
let the
with an
an r
is nothing
nothing short
short of
bound to
to hear
the world
but instead of
world weary
coming off as
not to
see the
the source
source of
trouble is
is i
i have
this should be
have already
be enough to
humor and
already seen
enough to warrant
and there's
seen it
there's hardly
hardly ever
i like
ever a
the audience but
like it
a moment
moment when
when she
wants to go
things is
steal the
film noir
the spotlight
shows us the
the 90s
her co
co stars
filled with
don't know
this is one
is one of
know if
and yet
breaking the
rules and
modern day
i for one
it seems
seems that
the style
not going to
going to be
this movie
in which
which it
is filmed
little more
is rich
in color
than some
during the last
actors are
the director's
are all
enough of
his trademark
and some very
however to
into this
sure it's
is basically
it's all
basically a
too good
a four
good to
be true
character study
true but
it will be
movies like
the character
character interaction
come along
for the characters
is and
sort of
and that's
but it didn't
that's the
a better
it didn't work
the real
real reason
version of
reason to
of basic
the actors do
basic instinct
this motion
as much as
much as they
as they can
they can with
is bound
what they are
they are given
picture of
people who
the non
love it
it or
love the
it there
the one
is the best
one that
there will
the best of
best of the
that has
of the film
has more
the film and
more to
who don't
and she is
don't want
she is given
do with
is given the
to admit
her character is
they see
than with
see but
tell you
to care for
anyone who
who sees
this will
to watch but
high school
but his character
his character is
school in
close to being
to being a
that any
would love
love to
get into
it's almost
almost as
has returned to
as if
are put
of film making
and her performance
her performance is
based on
course there
are those
who may
may look
compared to
but he does
the average
average person
tone and
may not be
not be the
in for
be the most
time we
we can
can turn
turn off
right wrong
a motion picture
while you
approach to the
thing to
to the characters
to happen
the characters and
it certainly
characters and their
certainly doesn't
turn out
out that
that way
way the
makes for an
film begins
with nearly
nearly all
main characters
movie it is
sam lombardo
lombardo matt
matt dillon
the students
the class
or hate it
kelly van
van ryan
i had not
denise richards
had not been
who has
has fallen
fallen in
however are
are two
kevin bacon
bacon and
to talk
talk about
about sex
what is
a sex
any one
to discover that
pretty much
that i liked
sets the
the tone
tone of
better than this
are about
about to
gives one of
one of his
of his most
suzie toller
there are several
stands up
and leaves
the room
could have been
have been better
but i think
part of
of her
her body
body and
some of the
of the most
in his role
doesn't want
anything to
the story is
continues to
to pursue
and the acting
the acting is
him she
she even
because she was
is top notch
to let
let her
has created a
star trek the
trek the next
a world that
the next generation
that's really
really all
all i
i can
can tell
was one of
you about
about the
any more
highlights of the
more would
would give
introduces us to
give away
the many
plot twists
twists and
and what's
jonny lee miller
what's more
is rated pg
are actually
rated pg for
along the
of scream
that film's
of the worst
surprises and
the worst films
worst films of
films of the
of the year
even more
the year and
to them
for her part
and if it
them there
if it is
twists in
film than
have ever
seen and
you think
think you
tired of
to interact with
them the
the surprises
are so
it's rather
going back
over them
them in
with her husband
my mind
all of
them work
though some
thankfully the
doesn't give
give us
time to
to think
think about
he refuses to
about each
each one
yet another
on us
before the
to find someone
the shock
shock of
the previous
previous one
to play the
one has
the role of
as for
the critics
critics who
nick nolte and
is this
just one
film however
however it
the kind
kind of
that isn't
hard to
it's good
a sense
one the
the screenplay
knows that
be taken
taken seriously
things to come
seriously and
as a matter
a matter of
includes a
a lot
lot of
be one of
story this
the x files
theresa russell
will be more
is more
a caricature
caricature of
that this film
this film will
way to
bill murray
murray who
who wears
wears a
to cover
is running
also provides
provides the
best character
as a result
and most
a result of
the genuine
genuine laughs
laughs and
two the
the sex
sex is
although not
have sex
sex in
in it
it what
film with
with that
breaks the
of having
sex scenes
also includes
with special effects
scenes between
the two of
two of them
don't worry
of them are
which is a
not as
as you
to one another
and with a
one another and
think the
and it doesn't
it doesn't take
scenes are
are quite
doesn't take long
the surprise
have expected this
full frontal
this to be
scene it's
to be more
it's very
very brief
more fun to
so if
and for
for as
as long
long as
him on a
can remember
think i
have seen
seen an
r rated
show an
of the characters
one before
the characters are
before it's
along with it
not completely
but judging
judging from
my first
the audiences
screening of
of and
and already
was more
gotten a
than they
a prime
candidate for
for my
during one
one scene
late in
film there
what an
seemed to
be a
a relationship
welcome to
the dog
days of
only film
but nothing
of it
makes you
a means to
you wonder
wonder if
if the
the studios
the director
opened in
had to
to cut
in late
cut it
in new
in order
new york
order for
york and
l a
a and
and which
or if
which are
are just
refused to
beginning to

do it
directorial debut

dances with
academy award
was its
award winning
its cast
first of
been one
the new
new year's
none of these
of movies
of these characters
movies as
as our
of my
my favorite
story opens
opens the
since the
the scream
films were
us that
that of
thousands of
only are
here however
however she
we then
she turns
cut to
the film lies
a plane
load of
role she
not in the
has done
in the script
done on
the script but
on its
head and
but in the
where one
and plays
plays a
gung ho
the closest
role to
to this
is perfect as
a romance
this was
perfect as the
was her
performance in
the craft
having the
the time
even in
time of
their lives
campbell is
they then
is probably
jump into
best in
that he is
wide range
range of
of talent
beginning the
here as the
can't get
get the
the image of
you can
the small
small parts
she will
be around
can sense

sense the
a long
is in
in trouble
trouble with
will also
also be
all about
about them
them and
she may
limited to
the roles
without much
here she
to express
tells them
them to
than in
from their
he manages to
soon to
to explode
in starship
starship troopers
to shout
day she
land a
very good
good role
role that
that can
display her
even get
ability and
get close
is nothing short
nothing short of
her voice
as the world
the movies
much or
she gives
the people
good performance
although her
they manage
manage to
is mostly
her and
left to
and move
the background
the source of
away in
a movie
first hour
movie that
hour and
of the film's
specializes in
the camera
she does
does get
the proverbial
get a
a bigger
young girl
trapped in
the male
a nearby
dillon is
it does
overly dramatic
giving a
a subtle
performance that
i don't know
don't know if
the postman
with every

right down
the film to
down to

he makes
makes the

and that's the
the real reason
reason to see
to see this

they seem

at home
even when
the fire
doing the

and almost
ever made

however he

cinematography is
stars as
as dr
in its

a man
man who
see a
join the
film like
the crew
convicted of
we should
it out
wife the
out and
watch it
premise of
just to

the woods
how the
revolves around
woods is
around this
is what

the music
a straightforward
was probably
most obvious
help them
flashbacks to
me as
fight the
the murder
set the
the perfect
mood for
are dropped
up an
dropped from
film it's
it's hard
times of
to describe
the night
who turns
turns out
just see
we don't
don't get
get to
see who
father who
it it's
who the
the killer
killer is
is until
much further
and be
be sure
the highly
sure to
to stick
story in
we might
might even
the closing
even have
closing credits
has finally
long is
put the
the ending
ending credits
to good
film doesn't
good use
after another
another to
to look
while most
time on
the details
use it
details of
it for
a chain
and conviction
over his
his head
scenes which
not the
the point
a speeding
story one
action scenes
explain the
the preceding
as we
some may
we get
may say
say that
arguably the
that these
the low
low point
point is
is when
his fellow
when he
to explain
escapes from
which leads
plot but
leads to
but it's
a fantastic
an entertaining
train wreck
a motorcycle
to finish
finish the
does not
not at
using a
are some
he shoots
moments in
straight out
in these
top of
credits which
which just
watch this
add to
and when
the fun
because it's
is appropriately
to take
he just
elements like
rated r
like these
r for
these and
for strong
and make
make them
original and
language and
and believable
and violence
again the
tommy lee
lee jones
is rather
the show
but let's
show as
film isn't
let's face
face it
people want
stock footage
footage of
see it
of actual
it so
a u
so why
why not
not give
u s
give it
it to
an expert
a no
no nudity
the moment
more by
moment he
he appears
use of
we know
know a
flames in
game of
her is
cat and
is from
ending with
and mouse
with its
as she
is about
she takes
to occur
takes her
be even
even worse
are equally
as there
movie perhaps
is no
no way
especially the
to tell
first one
be said
one we
said for
we see
is going
the picture
picture is
between the
the mother
the faint
mother and
film deals
deals with
how they
as bad
they got
bad as
as some
he tries
tries to
the television
find the
rating the
the language
who killed
killed his
ranging from
not have
for violence
violence and
to your
and language
your average
and would
be acceptable
here so
acceptable for
so it
profanity and
for teenagers
i can't
stuart and
script and
that make
film the
the target
as great
great as
is just
range and
use his
who should
intelligence and
it's definitely
definitely not
not for
himself and
and doing
doing his
his own
did i
i mention
mention that
work is
is very
very interesting
the only film
just as
however for
as little
those that
that do
do get
a chance
to why
chance to
why his
wife was
you will
was killed
so as
he learns
more so
will probably
so do
do we
in new york
likely be
new york and
be pleased
and may
l a and
using all
friends to
all their
skills to
next time
him down
down at
much as i
at one
one point
i wanted to
they run
run into
into each
each other
other and
this film as
film as i
just too
for them
is the first
them he
the first of
he leaves
first of the
of the new
show his
his innocence
innocence and
help him
solve the
the mystery
through all the
that of the
is its
if you liked
humor there
great sense
his two
cut to a
will have you
are trying
to catch
where one of
they believe
believe to
a dangerous
yet they
talk with
with each
falls in love
in any
any kind
the time of
of their lives
with this film
final act
this film i
with another
into the middle
middle of a
out who
even in the
in the beginning
him and
the beginning the
and although
although we
a typical
fight scene
scene the
case is
the man
i'm not saying
not saying that
that in a
in a bad
along and
but when you
when you see
realize this
see this film
until the
and with the
this film you
end when
you may be
the pieces
maybe the
scene is
much but
to get away
it still
by the film's
get away from
still has
a believable
atmosphere to
an r rating
that makes
the motions
go through
through to
make for
they manage to
not to see
a seemingly
to see the
see the film
as this
in a movie
what makes
a movie that
movie so
it and i
and i like
if only
i like it
more movies
is a film
of the 90s
trapped in a
of time
is probably one
probably one of
as it does
of the greatest
in which it
right down to
which it is
down to the
an over the
over the top
the actors are
actors are all
for the sake
the sake of
this is an
from the same
is an intelligent
story with a
with a real
a real sense
real sense of
into this film
to it and
and it works
to be the
be the next
too good to
good to be
to be true
a man who
man who is
looking for the
for the little
movies like this
sort of a
of a better
premise of the
of the story
the story revolves
story revolves around
is bound to
bound to be
in her own
love it or
who has a
there will be
don't want to
of the night
we don't get
don't get to
get to see
to see who
who the killer
the killer is
into the story
the story in
have a little
high school in
in the world
the world that
who will be
the film doesn't
to get into
much time on
goes for the
time on the
almost as if
the details of
as it is
it is not
is not the
the point of
point of the
the other three
story one of
of course there
there are those
we get a
compared to the
leads to a
but it does
it does not
not at all
and the audience
it is actually
so that he
that he can
to watch this
watch this movie
movie is so
able to take
in the woods
is what the
one thing to
tommy lee jones
to help them
steals the show
that way the
the show as
way the film
the film begins
along the way
begins in a
a u s
nearly all the
the main characters
sam lombardo matt
lombardo matt dillon
from the moment
cat and mouse
is about to
kelly van ryan
there is no
is no way
fallen in love
no way to
way to tell
is going to
most of the
the film deals
film deals with
as he tries
he tries to
tries to find
to talk about
to find the
what is a
does not have
not have a
have a lot
a lot of
who turns out
so it is
turns out to
out to have
to have been
that make the
sets the tone
make the film
the tone of
the film as
tone of the
it is just
are about to
is a long
that they can
as he does
part of her
as to why
over his head
anything to do
do with her
is when he
at one point
they run into
into each other
each other and
and a great
is just too
straight out of
of the top
the top of
top of the
all i can
i can tell
can tell you
and when he
to show his
about the plot
to help him
off in a
solve the mystery
of the many
when the film
the film isn't
plot twists and
to the film
the film is
film is its
sense of humor
there is a
is a great
a great sense
great sense of
are trying to
there are more
to be a
manages to be
even worse than
i have ever
worse than the
have ever seen
ever seen and
and even though
with each other
perhaps the best
that can be
can be said
be said for
of them the
said for the
but not in
the picture is
any kind of
the final act
it's not as
not as bad
as bad as
in my mind
out who the
of the television
nearly all of
all of them
it is rated
is rated r
rated r for
r for violence
for violence and
and would be
would be acceptable
be acceptable for
much time to
ever since
the man who
time to think
to think about
hollywood has
attempted to
to produce
more and
and more
more films
films about
and we don't
of the previous
the previous one
until the end
the end when
these films
as for the
audience a
a look
look into
that the film
that really
really is
scene is a
not impossible
impossible and
and is
it is this
is this is
but it still
this is pretty
if it's
it still has
is pretty much
not this
still has a
this the
about what
is real
however it is
greater than
it is the
than you
is the kind
you would
would expect
the kind of
guilty of
of all
it's not the
anyone familiar
familiar with
that makes the
and or
in a sense
so incredibly
incredibly stupid
stupid that
can't take
take it
those of
of you
you who
that it's not
not to be
to be taken
be taken seriously
world wide
as this is
are probably
of humor and
this is what
aware of
is what makes
what makes the
makes the movie
for movies
the movie so
who is more
sums up
is more of
extremely well
well with
think that
all the way
member of
the way to
and ridiculous
the human
the extreme
regarding the
seen a
bill murray who
any movie
and technology
movie could
technology and
could probably
just about
about every
one hundred
every turn
the wedding
wedding singer
though i
centers around
very hard
more specifically
to not
it follows
follows the
films as
the exploits
as i'm
exploits of
i'm watching
watching them
murphy a
a young
the best character
romantic comedies
plot of
character in the
this particular
film just
and most of
be extremely
seconds and
and sometimes
because if
minutes before
before i
it were
i actually
were not
actually saw
saw it
for that
is more than
who knows
screen but
where his
don't care
his career
not even
even a
film opens
supposed to have
opens with
to have sex
this are
adam sandler
sandler is
is great
drew barrymore
barrymore is
great the
so funny
and this movie
that left
left me
because i
was laughing
so hard
movie since
austin powers
sandler plays
a wedding
singer who
who once
once had
dreams of
of being
as you might
being in
a rock
band and
and writing
music in
the opening
opening scenes
seems like
a happy
happy go
go lucky
his profession
doing a
so if you
a rather
rather good
good job
job of
of talking
down a
a really
steve buscemi
for as long
as long as
decides that
that his
his brother's
as i can
wedding is
place to
don't think i
tell the
the whole
i have seen
whole world
his life
being arrested
up to
that point
point was
he was
a week
use a
at his
until he
is left
judging from the
years old

up at
at that
fianc e
angela featherstone

late in the
a waitress
the film there
is engaged
engaged to
seemed to be
to marry
marry him
him in
about three
three months
it makes you
makes you wonder

clear that
in order for
a jerk
jerk and
and that
and julia
love each
to do it
away at
trite and
the computer
if anyone
made me want
me want to
meets up
making this
up with
angelina jolie
suspense or
or something
matthew lillard
watching the
then they
been one of
the phantom
one of my
of my favorite
their audience
who are
are basically
aside from
do what
the terrific
costumes and
next to
computer and
is simply
and not
not get
get caught
i've never
never seen
the fbi
seen her
oh and
and as
look so
so close
sub plot
way she
she did
also tries
did in
to woo
not only
only is
is she
look at
at but
film really
but her
really i
her acting
acting job
can't think

much more
performance in the
good one

film's plot
doesn't hurt
hurt that
what i've
that she was
i've said
she was a
likable and
it's just
a bunch
well written
bunch of
written and
of computer
is probably the
played in
obsessive compulsive
probably the best
in full
full force
the best in
best in the
little too
as any
running around
villain in
wide range of
romantic comedy
i've ever
you can tell
the true
thanks to
here is
around for a
the guy
guy is
flat out
for a long
a long time
can say
say something
something that
that just
isn't funny
makes me
me laugh
his comedic
performance here
happy gilmore
film he
he goes
proves to
me that
own as
a leading
leading man
man in
his roles
his previous
previous films
one day she
a very good
gives him
him a
character that
that for
first time
time he
and then there
he actually
actually has
has to
to fit
fit into
as far
far as
to the movies
gives a very
does in
have some
his talents
unfamiliar with
talents and
left to the
now has
just so
the first hour
and what
moment is
hour and a
he sings
and a half
can do
a song
do this
song for
towards the end
movie makes
he claims
look a
little bit
bit too
writing it
it while
their time
while in
time and
matt dillon is
it after
after his
him this
the part
part that
had me
a breath
breath of
air and
and while
like all
he makes the
takes a
makes the most
most of it
plot has
up there
for what he
what he did
than enough
too many
hilarious moments
to list
to sum
many of the
make up
up for
for any
a terrible
in the theater
film if
if you're
the theater to
you're looking
film about
closer to
to what
what goes
goes on
on in
real world
world i
the second
i suggest
second half
although at
at times
times it
it too
may seem
seem a
very important
far fetched
the comic relief
comic relief and
it should
but who
be much
who cares
more believable
steals the film
are extremely
film as a
as a whole
a whole the
film didn't
the entire cast
the experience
experience is
enjoyable in
in addition
addition to
this i
can't imagine
imagine anyone
seeing the
the preview
think they
not wanting
wanting to
is portrayed
portrayed in
waste of
is pointless
to even
portrait of a
written this
a serial killer
review i
i just
just want
more and more
i laughed
i think that
his direction is
member of the
the audience a
of the human
the human race
ever seen a
seen a movie
the visuals are
just about every
turn in the
about what is
what is real
the wedding singer
even though i
that we can
you would expect
very hard to
in the air
of all of
all of these
anyone familiar with
more at home
the plot of
plot of this
shots of the
those of you
of you who
on screen but
but i don't
i don't care
of the pool
not even a
even a little
on the world
the cinematography is
adam sandler is
aware of the
you see a
see a film
a film like
film like this
like this and
just to see
in the movies
see how the
because i was
i was laughing
well with the
with the first
there is the
the most obvious
to the extreme
for the film
the film it's
it's hard to
being in a
the exploits of
in the opening
the opening scenes
he seems like
seems like a
happy go lucky
the closing credits
the ending credits
if it were
good job of
the film opens
film opens with
opens with a
with a young
is a good
that these are
to tell the
the whole world
to explain the
up to that
the film then
to finish the
at his own
at that point
there are some
at the altar
add to the
to the fun
meets up with
with his life
his life in
she is engaged
is engaged to
let's face it
trying to do
to do what
to see it
and as a
and the most
also tries to
the film really
love each other
i can't think
can't think of
way to go
making this film
much more to
to say about
the first one
say about the
about the film's
the film's plot
while watching the
one of her
it's just a
a bunch of
a little too
aside from the
to this movie
this movie the
i've never seen
and i can't
so close to
close to the
now has a
to the way
the way she
this film the
what they can
not only is
for the movie
to look at
movie is the
look at but
look a little
a little bit
a good one
are too many
that the character
the character is
did i mention
well written and
is a terrible
if you're looking
you're looking for
looking for a
for a film
a film about
is just as
get a chance
a chance to
to watch it
what goes on
on in the
in the real
i've ever seen
the real world
at times it
i think the
the next time
seem a little
first class
it should be

there's little
here that
few good
good lines
we haven't
problem is
haven't seen
dozens of
of times
times before
to revive
that many
is often
a scene
scene where
walking in
in with
by a

a slew
slew of
of jokes
thought this
jokes that
that aren't

a letter
was actually
actually pretty
pretty good

and obviously
is kind
of fun
slow motion
all they
film's final
can't act
a ton
few minutes
ton of
of detail
very well
should have
the images
been left
left on
especially during

the cutting
hand is
scenes involving
actress who
despite the
cgi the
three hour
several things
things are
are never
never explained
what was
such as
the war
how did
moments where
everyone has
who needs
needs to
where did
goes after
after the
a role
they come
come from
that shows
shows off
the law
him after
off her
law of
after all
her talents
all those
last year
lives by
year in
in both
event horizon
have its
film attempts
but at
beyond the
way too
least in
film but
in those
too much
but where
those films
much in
films she
where are
in such
she had
are we
a short
to believe
which she
span of
she could
show us
becoming a
world is
of war
here the
for control
best thing
do is
on one
made their
one hand
their way
hand it
a fast
fast paced
film on
is some
for much
a frightening
of its
that doesn't
its running
horror film
doesn't appear
appear to
and on
make sense
the tale
as my
a hilarious
is obviously
hilarious comedy
to its
be successful
director michael
evil in
in much
who did
would have
much the
did a
have to
same way
to focus
way that
focus on
directing the
the underrated
more action
the potential
potential to
one character
on every
beyond that
serving as
that would
the evil
is called
the problem
problem with
which sounds
like the
new age
to pull
three characters
at our
but why
as comic
why is
is it
coincidence that
his family
family are
takes place
in just
one liner
one year
if they
they were
were trying
after many
how about
make a
a horror
main character
character who
action comedy
comedy it
a healthy
have helped
relationship with
including the
later it
ending of
it turns
early on
out the
but unfortunately
new world
be impossible
family and
there seems
then there's
be some
there's the
some reason
the slapstick
reason for
that what
that but
scene between
but what
between a
does for
a sword
sometimes the
movie feels
and an
end is
a joke
thing but
really well
had a
armed with
done it
it had
with guns
had the
the feel
problems with
considering the
feel of
of slapstick
slapstick comedy
apologize for
for being
of recent
a chainsaw
recent years
chainsaw and
years it
a tremendous
of faith
to cheer
been a
of darkness
cheer for
for these
and funny
these guys
family film
film more
it feels
it's even
more importantly
importantly it
more difficult
difficult to
of place
to accept
place but
moving on
a level
least it's
break from
than it
is instead
instead it's
a complicated
the current
and under
playing a
the country
country and
of on
few laughs
of big
strives for
is pure
and since
since it
audience to
it left
get behind
me feeling
even with
stand by
by my
flaws the
movie all
is evil
evil and
and will
only for
will ultimately
who have
have the
have it's
find much
destroy the
but a
few of
of us
good time
we're all
the fall
fall of
caused by
redman has
has written
if there's one
this column
column for
for over
one thing i
over years
years and
i just can't
it's a film
the michael
a film that
last week
perhaps this
a note to
have used
a film review
film review by
review by michael
by michael redman
michael redman copyright
redman copyright by
copyright by michael
my opinion of
so many of
in a desperate
is not a
not a good
a good way
to tell us
from beginning
us that the
that the people
the people in
people in the
i thought that
the film are
and that the
the situation is
it's the year
film that uses
due to a
in the late
as i watched
i watched it
life in the
that there are
there are other
been reduced to
that i wasn't
it looks like
looks like a
or even the
even the slightest
as the film
the slightest bit
for that matter
to end
entertaining the
i must
my review
in exchange for
movie theatre
turn the
to use it
the sound
while a
good sound
to create a
were almost
it takes a
i walked
walked out
that might have
the theatre
might have been
i liked the
all of which
of which are
and you can
you can see
can see this
to get some
coming a mile
a mile away
some kind of
sound is
is particularly
will make
who at the
at the beginning
beginning of the
film is in
a film the
so he can
he can get
pretends to be
in a car
a car accident
make you
his name is
you're not
showing the
the trailer
trailer for
the promise of
be a great
a great movie
of days
because of his
was so
i couldn't
couldn't make
based on the
by the same
in the form
the form of
the same name
starts off with
off with the
wants him to
is in love
love with a
with a woman
her husband is
is killed by
before the film
in the most
to go back
go back to
for the rest
of money and
as a comedy
it has its
has its moments
making fun of
played by john
the book of
on the phone
in the process
to fight the
problem is that
is that the
has become a
to talk to
of course his
although the movie
there are so
are so many
so many things
this movie was
but it would
a ton of
and he has
he has a
we haven't seen
has a few
a few good
some of which
a scene where
scene where the
a slew of
the hands of
hands of a
the people who
is kind of
the film's final
all those who
should have been
left on the
unfortunately the film
the film attempts
film attempts to
attempts to be
on the other
the other hand
way too much
other hand is
in such a
needs to get
to get a
what was the
a role that
it is a
a fast paced
come from the
but at least
at least in
film on the
in which she
and on the
the film but
the best thing
for it to
it to be
to be successful
to do is
to believe that
believe that the
the film would
that the rest
film would have
would have to
of the world
to focus on
the world is
is in the
in the same
for much of
of its running
its running time
running time is
that would be
there is some
the problem with
problem with this
doesn't appear to
film is that
to make sense
is that it
that it has
much the same
the same way
way that the
if they were
has the potential
the potential to
trying to make
to make a
it would have
with his family
would have helped
early on in
character who has
relationship with his
it turns out
turns out the
and then there's
why is it
then there's the
that it takes
it takes place
takes place in
his family and
an army of
the ending of
ending of the
it had the
the feel of
why is the
the end is
end is a
but i had
there seems to
i had a
had a few
seems to be
to be some
with it and
out of place
of place but
feels like a
at least it's
a break from
have been a
it could have
on the whole
than it is
more difficult to
from beginning to
beginning to end
of the country
and since it
the country and
it left me
left me feeling
the audience to
a simple
simple plan
the movie all
finding a
the sound is
and getting
those who have
the cash
have the same
more about
will make you
of greed
that i have
greed and
and how
if you're not
can become
become the
when they were
of your
your life
the trailer for
trailer for the
yes there
much of an
elements of
but a few
end of days
the snow
a few of
and cold
it was so
the blood
have a good
blood and
a good time
and gore
it shows
shows how
set of

of events

to death
death and
murder mystery
the destruction
destruction of
lives and
michael redman has
redman has written
has written this
than anything
written this column
anything else
this column for
by how
day the
how many
the things
over years and
things that
most are
truth and
and honesty
sense it
making a
movie about
and manages
box office
with in
to the best
style over
best of his
not because
ending but
but because

way this
this becomes

but they
from there

needless to

after the first
what not

not want
the movie just
all his

plenty of

a challenge
from there the
that is
the characters in

affleck and
and do
his scenes
scenes with

right to

he doesn't

the million
questions in

packed with
billy bob thornton
mix of
but does
portrayal of the
performance as the
has much
much to
to recommend
recommend it
it no
no question
bad film
film at
convincing as the
the back
all it's
back of
very enjoyable
mind is
tons of
of great
great moments
the narrative
moments and
and lots
some critics
a room full
great things
room full of
argue that
things about
doesn't matter
is amazing
matter in
oscar nomination
films but
performances from
damon and
all films
and you will
films to
will end up
point where
end up with
up with a
chemistry together
with a simple
deserve to
we also
to feel
also get
feel cheated
some great
way if
you don't
it's not a
know the
the solution
solution to
and from
minnie driver
driver who
love interest
about an
an hour
hour into
story takes
takes an
moments that
the 1960s
an unexpected
tv series
i loved
comedy in
film especially
especially a
series that
had never
heard of
a college
before this
college student
movie be
student who
be happy
i won't
we witness
witness the
to impress
you with
with any
murder of
the serial
lame and
himself by
attempts at
who we
will smith
is none
a third
none other
scene in
other than
stab at
the author
entire film
one where
apparently the
the murders
he delivers
men in
the remainder
in black
remainder of
delivers a
directed by
same man
it's time
to some
to settle
the downside
can you
of working
working for
you say
say the
wife he
them i
the third
is finally
the relationship
revealed to
relationship between
to us
us as
people like
west and
killer in
will and
and sean
artemus gordon
the twist
his friends
are scenes
are supposed
responsible for
just amazing
the kidnapping
amazing to
kidnapping of
into thinking
thinking that
watch and
are even
during this
this scene
threatening to
take over
actually an
an innocent
within a
i felt
i did
did not
laugh once
whole time
once during
break up
this entire
entire picture
the killer's
you consider
consider that
to poor
first meeting
a part
a bar
that's not
good sign
i also
puts the
the timing
how he
way out
in other
any of
other words
his first
first wife
action sequences
in two
sequences which
at once
me with
with little
are also
who would
a ridiculous
would later
think back
a slow
the lovely
salma hayek
film's end
end you
and leave
scenes when
realise that
lonely and
and slightly
however the
flaw of
action adventure
a nasty
there's too
would say
of everything
everything and
scene to
not enough
make it
it look
it either
look like
either the
like he
film tries
hour of
attacked by
slow the
story line
himself on
the head
reminiscent of
take for
head with
for example
a bloody
example the
and uninvolving
thus the
the revelation
will the
revelation of
film gets
the hero
interesting but
gets an
very little
a killer
killer and
and anti
inside a
as well
hero in
well as
final scenes
may still
out any
an anti
but its
anti climactic
when it
it tries
show them
time the
them as
end credits
it falls
falls on
impression of
this big
its face
summer blockbuster
credits have
we hear
have rolled
they went
or as
went to
they say
end we
we do
say in
in french
learn that
town and
the bizarre
could it
flashbacks of
be that
scenes where
of personal
script was
film shows
that have
both of
it took
are at
times but
people to
along but
never takes
takes off
off like
too is
to write
a problem
parts of
their relationship
motivations are
his best
best friend
show up
the least
up until
last half
half hour
us a
better understanding
even then
understanding of
then we
don't see
see anything
see them
anything that
that its
around but
arrives at
at a
a decision
them it
for instance
a superficial
a teenage
teenage boy
we have
boy and
have come
a more
come to
to expect
leave a
hotel room
room and
more from
and minutes
never goes
minutes later
goes beyond
later we
smith and
the girl
big budget
best friends
friends and
movies that
his decision
off on
help but
we would
would assume
them on
of any
assume the
two best
their own
of something
something more
bad movie
was just
movie on
just me
me and
a positive
character we
note i
i could
honestly say
very much
enjoy the
but that
and simple
that again
again is
why you
may ask
course as
do i
as in
i go
in most
go on
most films
on about
the story's
opinion and
because when
relationship is
it comes
up every
comes to
scene that
and set
set pieces
most exciting
was also
fun as
we never
the scenery
understand what
see in
in each
bad guy
scenes in
guy but
other so
so when
that's pretty
the entertainment
she loves
loves him
him it
the streets
like it's
it's there
there for
at best
for plot
plot details
best the
details that
that anything
of holes
holes and
driver is
the score
is interesting
though and
a high
derivative of
a dozen
life into
and chases
into her
others i
character the
the writing
writing is
at fault
movie then
here but
escape from
from this
makes all
all this
scene with
tied up
film where
where it
a cage
tense and
sure it
and exciting
exciting and
little known
wealth of
known facts
of information
facts about
enjoyable the
the dialogue
about this
dialogue that
alone and
and its
its stars
that's exactly
exactly the
smith has
of thing
starred in
fresh and
and seems
the flaws
the ten
all time
too often
should get
a nomination
nomination for
for which
are less
which he
less than
he also
the sum
sum of
dialogue which
while this
mind you
song and
you if

turned down
worth a
look and
you're a
know it's
a fan
fan of

school of
a pretty
of drama
drama and
and has
albeit a
married to
a tad
the cute
cute as
the wonderful
best picture
cinematography by
since they
have two
a smile
a stylish
smile on
on my
great looking
my face
looking and
and quirky
film despite
of flaws
that gets

no problem
shame because
blown up

film has
on it
more recent
a director
known to
the aid
have worked
aid of
worked with
five of
movies including
i love
love you
take advantage of
proof that
gave up
up a
a successful
it if
career as
a major
one of those
star in
of those people
america and
moved to
to start
though she
more than anything
than anything else
she made
made her
feature film
debut as
it this film
an actress
actress with
film would be
a small
would be a
role in
and manages to
no not

her first
he can do
starring role
antonio banderas
about the time
since then
the time it
then she
has made
it takes to
made an
appearance in
was born
born in
the daughter
daughter of
father and
one day the
the actresses
of one of
cast as
breaking the waves
a stage
stage and
and screen
a big problem
he discovers that
to attempt to
to complete the
is on the
the next day
another is
done on the
van der
but no one
no one in
the world's
world's most
the cover
he decides to
decides to take
to take a
times as
interest in the
in the case
the case and
he and his
that i had
i had never
all is not
is not as
as it seems
of course they
the guy who
who did it
to his character
a fight with
with a bunch
men in black
directed by the
the same man
a police officer
this one and
can you say
in all its
responsible for the
the kidnapping of
one way or
way or another
is perhaps the
perhaps the most
to take over
take over the
to date and
performance of the
i did not
and there is
of the 70s
there is much
when you consider
at least two
film is a
is a part
two or three
that's not a
not a very
him and the
and the two
in that respect
tries to get
any of its
little more than
more than a
than a few
a few minutes
turns out that
needless to say
that the other
does not want
not want to
want to do
part of this
his life he
as an action
of the action
the action and
i would say
and that is
would say that
that is to
say that this
hang out with
out with his
and when you
that the first
first hour of
ben affleck and
hour of the
they are all
the film was
all the more
and a little
for the fact
to make this
the story line
that in this
in the footsteps
the footsteps of
and the special
be forced to
rather than the
to do something
he doesn't want
doesn't want to
to do this
set design and
appears to be
to be one
vision of a
this film which
film which is
world and the
but does not
not have the
as they say
could it be
is the perfect
is a bad
that the script
the script was
a bad film
film at all
it's a very
to recommend it
and lots of
the back of
that most of
of the special
things about it
about it the
the last half
last half hour
we don't see
to the point
the point where
that we have
have come to
by the way
so much more
way if you
if you don't
you don't want
will smith and
want to know
to know the
them on a
the comedy in
comedy in the
about an hour
a bad movie
the story takes
out of a
student who is
honestly say that
say that i
that i did
the murder of
performance by the
by a man
scene in the
in the entire
the entire film
entire film the
the one where
none other than
other than the
the remainder of
remainder of the
the relationship between
of the people
it's time to
that's pretty much
and his friends
there are scenes
full of holes
killer in the
in the film's
to watch and
and there are
there are even
the film which
which are so
see this movie
we are supposed
are supposed to
scene with the
up in a
but the rest
the whole time
little known facts
known facts about
facts about this
about this film
film and its
and its stars
two of the
there's too much
too much of
and not enough
the film tries
between the characters
take for example
for example the
the film gets
in other words
and has been
as well as
we are also
but when it
it tries to
the film's end
up in this
this film has
to the same
to make it
scenes where the
make it look
where the film
it look like
the film shows
like he was
of his movies
attacked by a
both of them
at times but
himself on the
on the head
never takes off
the head with
head with a
i love you
of their relationship
his best friend
career as a
has a nice
in the final
the final scenes
but not enough
to the united
to start over
even though she
by the time
the time the
the end credits
between the two
credits have rolled
it seems more
the end we
seems more like
more like a
a small role
learn that the
starring role in
an appearance in
maybe it was
each one of
it was just
to say the
say the least
was born in
the daughter of
daughter of a
of course as
as in most
films like this
like this the
we see the
each other so
off on the
on the back
back of a
she loves him
is the same
of the world's
the writing is
but what makes
of duty
series of
the film where
of television
dealing with
lives of
of law
law enforcement
the twilight
another one
one from
the series
series is
case of
that they should
rod steiger
would rather
spend a
of the dialogue
in prison
while this is
this is probably
s government
after being
being released
to pay
it's the same
to die for
the u
film i've seen
it's still a
in rural
if a film
the routine
out to be
turns into
i have no
that that
that brings
it to anyone
scene and
i guess
guess it's
a credit
credit to
to jackie
jackie chan
chan and
however his
his efforts
the franchise
rush hour
has many
could not
them even
the local
even by
comedy of
chris tucker
i'm a
of jackie
chan in
right wing
about any
when it comes
him not
the american
only do
it comes to
do his
impressive as
as ever
martial arts
show off
off his
his comic
comic timing
the most exciting
back into
until that
that time
better if
only the
title the
pay attention
attention to
stunts and
and special
time around
around the
led by
order to
lack of
of originality
who makes
makes his
like many
money into
tv movies
movies it
it creates
i'm still
still not
not sure
sure how
how you
shouldn't be
be on
a fortune
is there
there a
a place
place where
one can
for real
ones the
only way
as his
money from
wooden and
with some
to set
set it
it on
actors is
on fire
is terrible
fire and
kind of thing
and see
see what
course it's
it's up
film does
deal with
hong kong
thought provoking
films as a
and political
and half
the sum of
in front
front of
take the
bad guys
the total
total waste
the authorities
the extent
extent that
they even
the line of
stay out
turns the
the tables
tables on
dealing with the
with the real
and if you're
the real life
if you're a
that here
you're a fan
here it's
a fan of
who gets
gets the
them into
into trouble
trouble and
and lee
from the series
winds up
the series is
if you can
the case of
having to
get them
in some of
them out
out i
i guarantee
that my
my rating
who would rather
been at
least a
half of
a grade
film despite the
a shame because
been cast
u s government
because it doesn't
it doesn't have
have to be
to be that
shut up
only did
his voice
feel like
my head
with the aid
the aid of
just aren't
the u s
sub par
eddie murphy
any of his
chris rock
black man
wind up
up being
being more
funny i
i realize
realize that
movie like
laughs come
letting the
types of
you have
but didn't
an adult
realize how
that are
is all
children who
to offer
then i
care to
some of them
see any
to live
his films
in the local
a marvelous
but if
if your
straight man
man and
one actor
towards a
so completely
save a
in the american
saddled with
movie but
no other
almost too
name for
great to
to overcome
he's on
how a
never truly
to nearly
often hilarious
in question
hinges on
question is
value of
of how
like this one
is like
try to
like any
any other
pay attention to
a player
can think
the community
community and
and goes
goes about
about his
movie ends
much like
ends with
in order to
that as
as usual
beneath the
lack of originality
isn't perfect
scary and
perfect and
and evil
take him
see that
a mean
person he
a hard
hard time
lines as
control of
well and
be on the
anything he
the better
he says
better of
of him
him he
is quick
whole movie
quick to
movie a
of people
his actions
actions and
pointed out
and wants
a gentle
isn't very
person but
very different
but something
different from
something is
from its
its predecessor
a tendency
in tone
style but
also has
the original
the sequel
though a
a certain
with some of
his only
of the actors
connection to
love is
is his
his daughter
best to
to ruin
ruin it
the family
family man
her he
at an
pace and
to keep
she says
says that
the laughs
him his
the fairly
hour and half
puts his
his relationship
ratio of
in front of
the jokes
front of the
of the screen
she tries
to remain
not great
true to
but for
following review

buy into
that you have

an evil
the movie ends
beneath the surface
small town
town in

objects and
some of his
control of his
hard is
interest a
him he is
as well and
is under
under a
a spell
although he
and wants to
is unfortunately
in the whole
the whole movie
lot of people
of people have
moments when
from being
by some
there were
but i liked
the original and
me the
the flying
i like the

too obvious
obvious that
his best to

no idea what
what to expect
the film wasn't

the film not
is definitely a

many ways
ways that
been made
made over
over this
this new
new version
talented and
and high
made in
high profile
a time
time when
when one
one would
get involved
would think
an embarrassing
adaptation of
the infamous
film stars
sandra bullock
be made
and nicole
nicole kidman
as such
important to
it straight
long line
the start
and themes
their parents
in film
they go
live with
with their
of years
lying around
around in
and having
the present
waiting to
present day
a masterpiece
call it
home and
and meets
seeing this
a dark
film after
in mind
mind that
are people
me who
meets and
and falls
the novel
a sweet
man has
has two
this flick
since its
when her
well you
you just
is hit
hit by
a truck
wonder why
and killed
one really
she's not
not too
since she
worse is
over it
about two
two minutes
with anything
get her
her after
after having
and in
you really
sit down
body in
the crap
crap that
it's really
really quite
the dead
film perhaps
to mention
by director
light hearted
fatal attraction
good idea
idea how
seen this
is after
after seeing
wasn't so
there was
blown away
was not
it seemed
even one
scene or
element that
and surprisingly
enjoyed it
second time
not really
comedy to
sure but
thinking about
but all
the humor
waited for
what seems
flat and
the occasional
dramatic moments
least bit
forever to
entertaining in
seeing it
any way
way and
then to
a tv
to top
top it
set on
we've got
a giant
it really
taking over
whatever the
story itself
itself is
a surprisingly
are handled
and actually
one which
is why
why it's
it's such
do not
novel and
and why
getting to
be what
good film
you could
call a
reason why
old girl
decided to
a k
be in
k a
in every
scene involving
them they
it's about
about human
no attempt
made to
obsession with
are out
to flesh
out into
not your
same goes
human being
a handsome
being the
though he
he comes
comes into
the minute
minute mark
and once
once again
to develop
or his
every line
of dialogue
service of
moving the
plot along
i should
know i
headed for
opening credits
found out
screenplay was
was written
written by
managed to
the batman
batman series
batman forever
forever and
and batman
batman and
and robin
is directed
actor who
made the
the contrived
addicted to
meg ryan
ryan and
matthew broderick
that movie
bit but
give you
you a
a taste
taste of
of what
what a
tell him
while he's
last two
years he's
film that is
that is so
in so many
get involved in
involved in an
this one the
the film stars
and nicole kidman
comes from a
a long line
long line of
at the start
when they are
they go to
to live with
to the present
the present day
how we
destroyed by
by our
character of
almost a
symbol of
the forbidden
us but
we can't
meets and falls
and falls in
these ideas
ideas are
done in
a way
heavy handed
all but
and emotionally
the focus
focus of
come to think
to think of
think of it
for making
was to
to really
the emotional
depths of
and bring
bring them
to life
life on
screen in
images and
and scenes
one but
it's also
body in the
a tragic
telling the
story from
from his
every single
world of
not to mention
reflects the
and you have
sense that
you have a
that perhaps
perhaps it's
a pretty good
this that
has really
after seeing the
seeing the film
the film i
himself into
that there was
never lets
get over
is a comedy
his original
love and
to be sure
and allows
be sure but
himself to
but all of
all of the
her as
of the humor
his feelings
feelings for
and the occasional
and by
end he
has nothing
nothing but
are the least
the least bit
her the
in any way
a test
to top it
top it off
someone who
story of an
reading the
wrote the
to bring
and perhaps
thing about
that by
has reached
reached the
the finale
no reason why
can easily
to be in
be in this
identify with
opening and
and final
images of
in every scene
who hasn't
done a
a similar
action that
is made to
without any
any sense
of reality
or anything
else but
a deep
the same goes
same goes for
us this
who has the
screen the
of being the
being filmed
filmed in
in shock
even though he
stanley kubrick
the minute mark
with as
been able
do but
but did
did the
his character in
thing he
way in fact
for everything
came up
every line of
line of dialogue
dialogue in the
the plot along
in general
getting to know
that film
he used
used the
of society
i should have
the studio
final scene
during the opening
first in
the opening credits
film so
so to
the screenplay was
a murderer
was written by
and second
written by the
it gives
depth of
to destroy the
the batman series
a couple
and subtle
batman and robin
dialogue to
is directed by
an actor who
play it
comedy but
allow the
the tragedy
looking at
meg ryan and
at these
these two
especially after
a bit but
that when
read a
a novel
is even worse
film adaptation
that can only
give you a
by any
impossible to
to compare

it might be

it doesn't help
doesn't help that
work for the
as this film
film has been
tongue in cheek
has been in
seeing this film
after all the
there are people
the performances are
of the novel
who have been
doesn't seem to
seem to know
to know what
know what to
what to do
just have to
have to wonder
to wonder why
to pass for
even worse is
worse is that
the actor who
comes off as
watch this film
i wonder if
as part of
a series that
i've seen this
first time i
and the script
particularly in a
what seems like
see it and
to create an
it on a
side of the
and not a
the story itself
story itself is
itself is a
is a surprisingly
which is why
isn't the only
such a good
cate blanchett
why this is
this is such
is such a
a good film
who struggles

in a way
a way that
that is not
scenes that
just plain
plain boring
at all but
the focus of

the reason for
it it seems
the gift
those movies
wonder where
you've seen
this story
a collection
collection of
of every

a lack of
the original film
turned out to
with a new
allows him to
to capitalize on
the film follows
film follows the
of a young
a young man
outlook on life
focus is on
have to see
see the movie
to pick up
good it is
is like a
but there's a
mission to mars
into something more
it is after
when you are
will go to
and for a
it feels like
in the early
it has a
it seems to
to be saying
opens with the
that a few
here and there
be even more
when compared to
to the first
of the evil
attempt at a
as to whether
whether or not
or not this
is filled with
of all those
leaves the audience
the audience in
like the first
first film and
a good laugh
rest of us
plot a
of bad
dressed up
a vegas
during a
the boys
and when a
get together
together to
the money
money but
double crosses
goes down
down and
set up
who's on
the up
and up
who's the
guy and
gonna get
courteney cox
he's going to
the questions
which will
at least it
a sense of
sense of humour
of its own
that i've
seen so
so far
far this
this year
year it's
it's got
and it's
of bullets
go around
around a
a definite
well as some
through and
and through
if the film
to high
this sort of
the rough
not very
very original
have been much
original it
on for
too long
enjoyable to watch
long but
more or
or less
this movie's
got some
some pretty
scenes one
the film fails
the coolest
fails to make
a whole lot
whole lot of
the king's
playing in
background and
a decent
funny moments
suspension of disbelief
cast is
what about the
with many
name actors
actors as
they might
be for
do their
bit and
onto the
sequence in the
that holds
film together
the spirit
spirit of
himself is
who play
characters to
down this
surprised me
is the sort
the sort of
sort of movie
he's been
of late
he sure
played a
here in
line with
is having
having fun
ass and
and making
making sure
sure there's
do what they
around to
you got
really great
all too familiar
it all
all at
the violent
movie are
wrapped in
a soundtrack
to no
surprise to
anyone that
movie comes
a music
music video
with plenty
it actually
actually works
works the
to act in
it starts
the gun
gun on
us and
despite some
enjoyed the
the overall
was as
and did
movie no
well i
without her
be honest
take up
is generally
that's what i
in blood
an average
the king
can guess
no secret
role as
cop who
was after
also like
these types
of guy
movies a
the table
does offer
fbi agents
offer a
but of
story some
been set
and turns
straight from
probably not
makes a
for everyone
a run
everyone but
who enjoy
follows is
guys and
brought to
us by
executive decision
another film
used to
way through
through this
below the
far superior
recommend this
but even
even on
on it's
it's own
or any
movie while
intelligent and
and had
leave your
to root
root for
baby and
mainly because
so little
little about
about him
one to
return to
i really
gave a
stuck in
little time
the ghetto
in there
neck and
and love
the place
and no
almost immediately
immediately to
i got
care less
movie i
mean it
me up
the devil
character gets
in disguise
little screen
you won't
for reasons
falling in
jones is
fine as
so don't
don't be
role is
is hardly
hardly a
turn away
the sense
with your
whether she
same role
not and
is seemingly
dog of
last film
film there's
trust me
me i
apart from
it my
from that
the heartbreak
that i'd
i'd seen
is ok
year is
far behind
fbi agent
behind me
has now
left the
chase and
and sexy
his mind
mind and
thank you
you very
where's joblo
joblo coming
get carter
in and
and out
movie as
reindeer games
looks as
reservoir dogs
if their
and all
the performers
performers are
on autopilot
of bad guys
the supporting
supporting cast
cast are
o k
falls flat
flat on
any better
plot wise
film starts
to capture
and the crew
set up for
up for the
the up and
a million
million times
is using
using the
bad guy and
wasn't the
are just a
this would
few of the
straight to
to video
made at
and because
rest of this
of this movie
apart and
that i've seen
features in
so far this
far this year
this year it's
director is
all right
right but
out it's
action movie
the plane
to go around
plane crash
lacking in
are nice
crash and
through and through
suffers from
of excitement
it's not very
and dumb
it goes on
goes on for
for a little
little too long
performers and
and script
not make
good action
overall rating
by david
david wilcock
more or less
provided by
the sequel to
playing in the
in the background
the background and
his role as
the cast is
they might be
for the most
the most part
most of them
but of course
and when the
this film together
he makes a
the spirit of
what follows is
characters to the
to us by
the director of
this movie to
at all the
is a pretty
here in the
the end the
the bottom line
with this movie
to root for
root for the
because we know
same time the
in this movie
this movie are
to be honest
be honest i
and the entire
and his character
little screen time
he is the
to the next
no surprise to
that the director
director of this
his role is
a music video
the sense of
and i mean
for this kind
the same role
film is not
it starts off
from the last
film there's a
there's a few
a way of
way of the
in the game
in and out
and out of
for what it
what it was
the movie as
looks as if
having a good
and all the
the supporting cast
supporting cast are
falls flat on
covered in blood
the film starts
film starts off
you can guess
film is an
that i am
a million times
these types of
though the film
and because of
twists and turns
and a big
the director is
is all right
all right but
not a film
but there's no
a film for
is the usual
bad guys and
special effects are
and there's a
there's a good
recommend this movie
or any other
to return to
return to the
make a good
a good action
stuck in the
batman film

during the film's
some genuinely
genuinely funny
moments to
be found
as when

and just
as another
of conflict
the idea
idea of
of not
not being

credit for
the fake
work of
of art
has ever
ever created
fair to
more attention
reaction and
have made
made this
four star
star film
a classic

its flaws
i'm not quite
not quite sure
quite sure how

a flat
whole way through
their hands
somehow he
he ends
ends up
their car
car and
that it would
line up
up of
featuring the
the likes
likes of
on the way
of other
it's here
to hit
speaking of
of life
few of them
and somehow
point in
movie of
into play
in the tradition
the tradition of
the magical
in good
good with
his boss
robert loggia
long for
the dog is
is actually a
left and
and right
and poor
and those who
plot points
only a
sequence involving
revolves around the
have any
nothing to
movie has
all that
that came
me is
a young girl
girl in the
get more
guy in
the question
least he
has something
is likely to
the happy bastard's
happy bastard's quick
bastard's quick movie
quick movie review
along with his
of some sort
he comes across
and by the
on their hands
the end he
he ends up
ends up in
a wave of
as i said
the likes of
is not quite
but there are
to be found
such as when
as a means
it's here that
thing about this
that by the
point in the
the movie of
movie of course
is coming from
comes into play
with him the
we have the
to get in
images of the
film are the
are the same
take long for
long for the
any sense of
left and right
shows us how
is the second
to have any
for the screen
the screen the
turned into a
his character and
to the screen
the screen with
with as much
that the movie
the movie has
movie has a
been able to
able to do
to do but
but all that
to me is
is that i
that i could
came up with
the guy in
guy in the
in that film
at least he
the final scene
that of a
get me
what's going on
going on and
the film so
has happened
happened to
all good
a deal with
deal with the
action movies
a meeting
you see it
see it it
gives the film
to come up
of a man
come up with
and taking
gun toting
characters of
the s
from such
such films
even with the
the film falls
turn into
to play it
an honest
don't mean
that there is
is in fact
sylvester stallone
prime example
going on in
in charge
the film never
into action
have long
long since
of the american
has a lot
who tries
a lot more
a few scenes
few years
years ago
it's true that
made a
that gave
gave him
of the aforementioned
roles that
that role
role was
to assume that
i have never
have never been
a broken
performance and
of a film
film in which
he had
film adaptation of
adaptation of a
too bad
it is and
action but
carter is
simple story
i loved the
have given the
played with
nearly as much
of actor
tom sizemore
work as a
gets himself
a drunk
play is
is involved
involved and
and travels
travels to
the first place
it does have
they are doing
does have the
some of that
walks around
that is in
the casting of
of the two
dressed like
the two leads
a lost
enough money to
to pull it
pull it off
it off the
the film takes
finds out
film takes a
some bad
in a very
a slimy
the end as
no one can
mickey rourke
are willing to
a multi
willing to go
the way he
to go in
order to keep
he brings a
to the role
michael caine
the role that
who speaks
speaks in
while trying
to identify with
to figure
identify with the
with the audience
with the rest
the audience and
brother and
the world and
to extract
revenge on
this sounds
like another
not tell
him off
the title character
with the idea
the idea of
a remake
not being able
the british
being able to
production of
even better than
role and
did in the
what with
in his mind
it's easy to
easy to see
to see why
fair to say
to say that
little bit more
that she can
like an
attention to the
old guy
guy trying
at any time
taking him
his one
fall flat
a four star
tired and
film and a
scene involving a
the issue of
of an american
a bizarre
tone to
is a very
words the
biggest surprise
there are two
characters in the
job done
the film one
the beginning and
actor in
and the other
a boxing
the film still
attitude towards
mother played by
not getting
getting his
in the book
character he
plan to
he may
may make
my book
has great
she's the one
hundred years
and still
acting by
not understand
and energetic
car chases
concentration camp
last days
as played by
of world
thing it
war ii
it lacks
as with
with most
most hollywood
days the
steven spielberg's
never mind
survivors of
the five
to watch a
watch a film
a film and
by their
you try to
the introduction
what the hell
who could have
even as
could have done
started to
lose the
than the one
war the
the nazis
up their
in europe
of the bad
of jews
is not really
they became
became the
the other is
target of
of the s
each of
such films as
who is also
tells his
his or
or her
her story
stories are
normal life
recall the
sent to
realization that
were actually
and i don't
i don't mean
lives in
the deaths
their family
of hope
a prime example
prime example of
and finally
finally the
and the result
result is a
is a character
a character who
their old
amazing and
the exact opposite
exact opposite of
opposite of what
by themselves
the stories
who tries to
tries to be
but by
as you can
most of these
of these are
days is
these are not
a talking
a few years
on the part
few years ago
the part of
pictures of
intercut with
gave him the
a whole new
almost impossible
and place
but director
director james
go with
is for the
his subjects
the story the
but with the
the only two
not clear
scene it
of the time
two that
i hadn't
hadn't seen
seen before
is a simple
shot by
the brink of
the end with
about seeing
the pictures
in his car
the footage
is the only
part of his
of his life
there has
movies and
comedy that
have anything
end but
anything new
not without
new to
say but
providing a
good deal
focusing on
deal of
have one
they're not
not funny
they think
funny but
devoid of
of anything
detail and
i'm glad
because his
funny movie
past the
up well
to other
other movies
movies on
a really bad
people for
rich and
finds out that
and beautiful
out that his
setup and
is built
take place
about as
the few
blue and
movies i've
where i
also the
was shot
shot on
almost all
couple of
video so
so the
pieces that
a laugh
features are
a theatrical
jim carrey
introduction to
while trying to
the subject
trying to figure
subject matter
high powered
to figure out
to whom
the production
and how to
crew and
he takes
the private
though his
revenge on the
the survivors
have for
versions of
for each
right away
and full
wife is
both on
another man
now it
more interesting
like they
they may
together the
with them
them of
sets up
up this
with good
a remake of
a remarkable
remake of the
balance of
of jim
jim carrey's
instead they
with reality
are solid
that were
were probably
cut from
his birthday
a confrontation
was only
on camera
what happens
a german
happens next

television and
that requires
requires him
movies it's
twist the
the events

that the best
it's only
done in the

of interesting
is by the
interesting and
one he
he uses

to test
his ability
to lie
and nearly
his office
right now
about it for
scene he
write the
like someone
someone in
he may not
it's like
the last days
like he's
last days of
of world war
world war ii
in the last
ask why
water to
survivors of the
the courtroom
it fails
that would make
as with most
ask what
them this
scene alone
the tape
for minutes
never mind that
never have been
and also
have been made
flashes of
almost the
end a
warren beatty

is just about
just about as
of the few
movies i've seen

almost all the
the use
the way through
instead of a
when his
of a couple

acts like

comes as
a delightful
surprise the
film manages
to break into
break into a
to cross
if i
accessible to
both children
and adults
that same
same exact
movie though
and he wants
though is
a performance
the animation
animation is
is first
first rate
the rock

toy story
believe me
jack nicholson's
something to
in as
every frame
great performance
certainly a
performance but
isn't so
enjoy it
so for
though because
a worthwhile
that should have
scenes but
point and
viewers will
sequence where
when we see
where we
it even
see her
we have no
have no idea
no idea why
behind all
her actions
time she
she actually
all year
and begins
i know that
her life
plagued with
because as
no wonder this
and demands
things from
of movie that
to deal
what she
give her
that was the
sister who
an otherwise
is by far
actress and
far too much
is absolutely
was in the
i've seen in
seen in a
in a while
brilliant as
a while i
in spite of
spite of the
i can't remember
can't remember the
remember the last
the last time
other critics
i know i
performance the
all the plot
are up to
up to something
living in a
because she's
a concentration camp
one who
who doesn't
the law and
the boring
you hear
be from
from me
me after
comes up with
tom cruise
a life of
have gotten
wants to do
does and
to go and
and both
both have
hell the
haven't been
not a great
been seen
been for
the plot twists
that deals
the film has
much with
with jackie
jackie and
film has a
has a little
enough with
because it was
had gotten
it was made
not as a
the entirety
i'd say
but as a
top ten
best films
film it is
it is an
to perfection
is an old
perfection in
up to look
treatment of
its subject
subject and
what sort of
shred of
doubt in
this is director
film but he
be but
but hey
does have some
the most important
about this movie
the latter two
movie is that
is that it's
of a trilogy
movie of the
of the month
side of a
a man and
a sort of
metaphor for the
part of what
of what made
what made the
these characters in
everything that is
uncanny ability to
ability to make
to make an
will have a
have a hard
great deal of
a film of
in the hands
and his team
and not the
not the least
in the us
in what is
for a quick
the style of
of it all
reference to the
and makes the
film the plot
films but it
it would be
thing is the
story of two
i give it
it a on
a on the
on the to
the to scale
to scale and
their relationship is
scale and a
and a on
the center of
part of it
center of the
of it is
the story that
and uses
that makes this
who in the
makes this film
doing so
i've always
up with the
could have had
film can
or what
you i
i find
this fact
to complain
movie goes
tells its story
as if it
and money
it is but
another thing that
and way
perhaps if
if one
foul mouthed
every other
to the very
the film tells
film tells the
tells the story
references to the
to the great
con man
and ends
than one
one person
him when
finally gets
raiders of the
of the lost
the lost ark
than three
three people
indiana jones and
jones and the
want him
dead or
there's even a
alive the
they are also
a nod to
and when it
the cops
cops who
in a little
him of
of murder
at the expense
the expense of
charlie sheen
prove himself
himself a
offers to
and soon the
will just
allow him
him an
it when you
these elements
elements are
are completely
however and
as expected
expected the
around the world
the odd
odd couple
the world but
the heart of
end which
is another
seeing as
as how
they show
of becoming
any point
way there
original or
are either
or just
forgotten about
blair witch project
paint by
by numbers
on the radio
the radio and
that lacks
lacks any
any real
out of all
a predictable
one or two
storyline and
two dimensional
dimensional characters
the eyes of
characters make
make money
eyes of the
a reason
save your
your money
a film can
if you had
seen the movie
when a movie
it's not so
so much that
to sleep with
you've never seen
even if you
if you have
you have no
no idea who
mel gibson is
an interesting character
is about a
does not need
have been the
the time that
and ends up
ends up with
with more than
more than one
out to get
to get him
that are never
no less than
less than three
such a way
here is that
it's not about
if you've got
and the characters
relationship with her
i might add
that it's hard
it's hard not
hard not to
is the most
every one of
but with a
to prove himself
else in the
the entire world
known as the
to get back
the odd couple
in some way
seeing as how
to the most
the way there
ever seen in
there is just
in a film
and so many
share the same
or just plain
and the whole
their love for
with most of
paint by numbers
the best one
make it a
a reason to
save your money
that seem to
seem to have
starting with
little mermaid
most recently
the lion
lion king
walt disney
proved that
they could
up with an
of the three
in touch
for this is
this is that
that it's a
surprise that
big fan
to come off
disappointed with
it comes as
comes as a
is surprisingly
the film manages
in broad
film manages to
as are
its characters
characters a
lead by
world in
of gold
gold with
the animation is
with no
is first rate
that this was
that if i
the natives
if i had
the english
with just
fear and
the love
and you see
she has to
is this movie
out is
not entirely
attention to detail
to be seen
stereotypes and
and lack
single minded
has something to
appearance is
a blond
it as a
at heart
the typical
heroine who
you don't believe
is practically
don't believe me
and finds
finds the
just in
in time
movie i've seen
i've seen all
seen all year
talking animals
capsule a
not just a
films made
made by
an odd
by steven
thanks to the
steven spielberg
it's one
elements that
where we see
really work
work the
the animals
the island
a delight
island of
their interactions
see some
some new
brings the
rather bland
the time she
gives us
nice and
and begins to
better film
we saw
saw the
story unfold
through their
their eyes
eyes the
the talking
who seems
low to
a thing
thing for
is the last
for john
on which
only other
other character
expect to
interest and
jurassic park
the bunch
a welcome
delight in
the later
of ways
disney films

here with
a creative
the exception
exception of

the viewer
the children
able to give
insights into
to give her
a kid
car to
from seeing

they want
wants them
to most
i believe
written characters
be disappointed
biggest problem
all out
that disney
disney has
on an
an island
fairy tale
more complex
all the other
to change
even that
a movie's
than i
entertainment value
was expecting
characters who
start out
doesn't work
stupid and
the one who
prove to
neither as
the viewer's
minds and
degree of
of complexity
combined with
in quality
i feel
more obvious
as mentioned
many questions
questions that
me while
viewing the

was truly
experience with
why did
did he
created for
the now
so quickly
change his
no doubt
a safe

years earlier
sam neill
say this is
best films of
act as
kids the
short the
for adults
adults and
romance and
but again
enough action
action or
to drop
humor for
doing and
doubt in my
a wealthy
william h
h macy
macy and
they end
been just
on too
many levels
the little mermaid

as it turns
is how
more sympathetic

too fast
just in time
really hard
to resist
even try
they're just
few times
really really
sweet and
and charming
again with
money on
nora ephron

with the exception
the exception of
open a
exception of the
the island of
across from
the corner
and gives us
gives us a
silly and
have been used
every day
day they
fight to
the death
a charming
had a good
is even more
the romance
have it
be in a
in the audience
film in a
in a lot
goes through
the lost world
having some
that they want
and happy
the biggest problem
film version of
it's going
happen the
is now
cast with
a host
host of
of others
including a
what all the
cute and
and wonderful
insights into the
me feel
he always
it here
an all out
he's still
on an island
what this
viewing the film
are a little
boils down
to it's
the godfather
appear to be
jokes the
the superb
and even that
script it's
that is a
than i was
i was expecting
third of
movie really
really doesn't
have liked
prove to be
comedy it's
knows the
the secret
was such a
a nice guy
looked at
at my
my watch
he should have
or how about
deliver the
for so
the story opens
home at
story opens with
a reasonable
hour the
be really
e mail
kids are
the benefit of
this was the
benefit of the
more with
in movie
work together
it's nice
nice to
gives you
well a
film is too
are absolutely
that always
come at
right time
with my
my father
the drive
back home
home on
on what
in many ways
the purpose
purpose of
believed that
some of their
movies are
are very
very powerful
they end up
has three
he needs
survive the
the ability
find a
entertain and
movies can
the school's
two and
i'd rather
not think
i always
succeeds in
that made
despite this
this film's
made you
interesting premise
and dark
and made
see something
something from
from another
that films
and presents
presents us
us with
because you
of tom
forgot about
about your
and thought
thought about
add that
about something
that to
a completely
a night
night and
was thinking
wait for
has had
an ending
ending that
that takes
takes all
force behind
the year's
year's best
films in
that truly
very bad
bad things
example and
and you've
he's also
yourself a
a trite
worthy of
of pure
matter i
pure entertainment
laughed at
found the
and repetitive
and was
find any
gratuitous nudity
anywhere in
it gave
gave me
gonna make
comedy at
this one's
for the new
you've got mail
on the internet
tom hanks and
and meg ryan
skip it
that thing
thing you
first feature
director tom
they are both
opposed to
for all of
ago it
films such as
wasn't until
saving private ryan
tape and
and decided
to risk
tom hanks is
is best
best known
going to get
played the
on tv's
question is how
the bell
parents are
directing a
that they are
a look at
all of their
due to the
to find a
you get the
get the idea
and if you
in the water
you don't get
don't get the
but i like
in trouble and
they are the
are the most
the most amazing
because it is
presents us with
united states and
with one of
going back to
i don't really
know is that
wait for the
really hard to
out of this
i'm not going
a black comedy
out in the
what he is
he is doing
them in the
and you've got
sleepless in seattle
william h macy
who has been
a little different
years ago and
her she is
this movie if
for the kids
they have a
there are no
and they have
they have no
that thing you
thing you do
first feature film
but is still
of the fact
film seems to
it wasn't until
has decided to
one thing that
that does not
around the corner
is best known
best known for
by the bell
they seem to
seem to be
to be doing
it all the
all the time
to the death
the time they
they did not
and one that
the previous films
in with the
must also
respect the
wants to have
to have it
they are a
also has the
of being a
not only are
films and
more intelligent than
than in the
in the past
kevin smith
debut with
is a solid
they are not
the dreadful
for what they
what they do
the movie goes
may be a
which have
be a little
bad is
and confused
which were
now i
of course in
quentin tarantino
this film a
two films
their way into
you know it's
one being
being one
it's going to
going to happen
the question is
known as a
time but
just wasn't
wasn't that
that good
good of
a host of
jackie chan's
a great scene
that looks like
the mtv
an oscar
guess that
and for all
the visual effects
robert rodriguez
it makes me
great director
view of the
a cool
on the outside
comment on
on them
them but
this crap
a few times
film all
all four
now in
all fairness
never really
work out
of new
but have
have heard
which is what
heard the
what this movie
boils down to
the musical score
musical score by
score for the
to par
to his credit
to you
you on
third of the
simple one
one a
tim roth
a god
god and
i would have
would have liked
couple good
good moments
the film they
moments is
is working
working on
on new
year's eve
a long way
shift in
he's the
at my watch
one there
he only
if you get
only has
you get a
yet again
to deliver the
the seemingly
very much like
pulp fiction
so that i
i rate it
rate it a
goes to
and a low
on he
is that this
a low on
low on the

and like
like his
his other
is where
director robert
of the year's
the year's best
he spends
spends the
which is one
listening to
to new

the tv
so we
and co
and help

movie it's a
his home
depending on
which the
focuses on
when everything
to cope
cope with
with numerous
nicely and
of fate
can we
and danny
are funny
our own
why they
said it
director writer
it moves
him but
slowly and
but these
aren't any
it's more
the all
ending was
funny at
the history
history of
of rob
oh the
two main
spend the
has played
entire movie
major role
each other's
leaves his
life the
glimpses of
while he
women and
and music
music the
go out
the inevitable
conclusion is
that keeps
camera is
bucks to
does this
watch his
his kids
all night
over to
but things
things go
life as
go wrong
hope davis
man from
also helps
from hollywood
a melancholy
open the
eyes as
to how
bruce willis
is jack
live in
her boyfriend
show with
be considered
a total
best for
home from
reason it
finds her
done with
he plays
their apartment
who must
actor or
amusing and
day of
just had
the week
does so
office hit
so well
hit on
his hands
hands and
makes us
feel sorry
sorry for
by playing
playing an
doomed to
to fail
plays his
why he's
the strong
strong supporting
he lacks
lacks the
the courage
big stars
to confront
stars and
and character
actors that
see if
ten times
life and
times in
a row
a stand
he explains
drunk and
the while
something the
the remaining
cast members
physically and
to hold
he then
hold the
grace of
only problem
surprisingly effective
have ended
instead the
that her
her daughter
of cash
twenty minutes
minutes that
exactly what
takes out
that also
ad for
horror the
the ad
halfway through
comedy with
for life
film made
soundtrack and
high on
they make
and feel
she meets
the thing
two years ago
he realizes
the coen brothers
realizes that
the big lebowski
give this
this a
as he's
stars but
a fish
wasn't very
good he
he starts
very long
wearing a
a wet
then goes
makes no
no sense
then he
makes it
oblivious to
it's been done
been done before
long and
the fish
a trio of
see him
a train
did with
what's the
the moral
having their
don't do
do an
an ensemble
is much better
stories and
his attempts
these guys are
get on
the job
and you know
and they're
embarrassing to
to carry
carry on
to laugh at
another subplot
his father's
working with
crap but
everyone involved
i especially
makes you feel
look forward
life at
forward to
you feel good
feel good about
is put
put on
debt to
the cool
the manner
from dusk
manner in
dusk till
till dawn
he pays
movie tries
too hard
i suppose
suppose it's
a likable
his dream
what you are
makes him
seem more
more realistic
realistic and
personality the
film moves
moves along
along at
of cinema
i seem
so in
they aren't
seems to know
know what he
human beings
who make
throw a
hollywood is
of possible
his big
red herrings
and let's
let's hope
hope he
the mix
fact that they
has made a
both were
destined for
other as
they share
share a
moment the
comes in
that we've
we've come
is the character
the pair
yet we
to relate to
but he is
and make the
belief in
the subtle
can bring
to one's
a quiet
none of which
pleasure in
a cinematic
littered with
he spends the
first two films
being one of
the two main
two main characters
films of all
of all time
the entire movie
way too many
made this film
he was also
so i guess
i guess that
in which the
is also a
a great director
to cope with
in the history
the history of
in all fairness
a major role
major role in
in his life
of new york
his life the
the plot in
directly to the
to the camera
the camera is
his life and
up to par
but i will
all the while
his way out
way out of
the scene with
as to how
a simple one
and all but
a man in
in this one
in her life
though he has
has a couple
day of the
new year's eve
of the week
her as a
is that he
he's the only
the only one
feel sorry for
he only has
only has a
strong supporting cast
moments of the
he goes to
he is trying
trying to say
the only problem
only problem with
that it doesn't
it should have
movie goes on
we see him
on a train
is completely wasted
wasted in a
in a brief
halfway through the
through the movie
painful to watch
to watch the
something to do
do with a
comedy with a
his attempts to
to bring back
to get on
on the big
look and feel
to carry on
was supposed to
a planet
ruled by
is taken
some other
humans and
and tries
tries his
him to get
to get it
yeah and
the apes
can talk
the manner in
manner in which
looking like
burton movie
the only good
movie or
or its
only good thing
good thing about
the movie tries
too hard to
hard to make
did find
find myself
the film moves
that sets
moves along at
from all
others is
so in the
in the latter
jobs and
mean i
was completely
into the mix
as the two
each other as
comes in the
in the fact
gets in the
the alien
so this
review is
obviously a
least i
it of
doesn't mean
that i'm
i'm gonna
giving this
alien resurrection
at least this
the fourth
as hell
film much
however it's
which never
to entertain
consists of
series in
short i
who gets to
where our
our heroine
sigourney weaver
answer to
after discovering
discovering that
an alien
to pop
it did
did to
john hurt
be the same
anything i
liked it
on the tv
we get to
to see her
back as
which means
that's a
to have the
bad thing
a cliche
an even
but when i
when i watched
the necessary
by none
because they
but as i
get past
out where
although i
think it
third one
on board
a band
band of
including michael
michael wincott
winona ryder
for a couple
it but
to watch his
you've been
past two
things go wrong
you probably
probably know
it although
a non
between her
it's never
oh well
and run
run around
the ship
ship and
dan hedaya
death is
since well
or are
are left
and stop
the aliens
aliens from
is heading
just an
an excuse
excuse for
good old
fun the
there's always
always a
in aliens
ripley and
that each
different in
alien is
exercise in
a wild
a bleak
of like
an off
off beat
french film
with lots
and cool
jean pierre
without his
his usual
creates a
a ship
are really
really cool
especially with
is sometimes
certain scenes
scenes there's
face off
not every
anything like
this as
as interesting
visually and
the others
chase scene
who has just
box office hit
jaw dropping
his hands and
earlier film
way they
do in
best scene
film i'm
i'm sure
first to
to see if
variations on
in a row
to hold the
screenplay by
it never
is so much
does make
make us
us care
care about
there's very
little of
like one
lot of money
part in this
very funny
funny lines
who do
bunch of people
get off
people who are
get you
off but
ship the
all around
around with
to realize that
stand out
the thing is
it doesn't seem
doesn't seem like
he realizes that
that if he
the poor
and the dialogue
like she
with a very
a very long
a variation
variation on
makes no sense
for a while
pulls it
it's just not
not very good
did for
but she's
a thrilling
entertaining film
two but
third installment
best part
which isn't
isn't really
really a
to them and
it being
to not only
not only the
but to the
to the actors
it's entertaining
entertaining as
hell and
fit for
alien series
of the alien
look forward to
this review is
is obviously a
at least i
it of course
to the top
that doesn't mean
doesn't mean that
from dusk till
dusk till dawn
i suppose it's
he made the
i seem to
much like the
very good film
in the style
style of the
of the series
don't need
need to
is with
with few
few exceptions
tend to
be worse
follow up
only reason
reason it's
the predictable
storyline the
cardboard characters
characters the
failed attempts
at humor
humor the
effects the
bad acting
direction the
back on
planet earth
i liked it
much as the
as the first
and more importantly
a bad thing
on mars
an even more
out at
right there
well as the
least one
by none other
crew is
now a
of alien
because they have
first movie
urge to
although i think
reaction to
i think it
tv show
show which
she appears
to enjoy
go off
each time
which we
are forced
gross out
there doesn't
it might have
of reason
in the third
hope it
a band of
can't really
totally wasted
scientist who
i told
bit of a
referring to
but more
aimed at
makers of
reprises his
the past two
past two years
you probably know
as does
between her and
what's a
a talented
you might have
let him
directing this
an unfortunate
throwing in
their names
on the ship
peter hyams
gave us
the relic
no thanks
by roger
certainly no
are left to
just that
no better
out there
the ship is
offensive and
and insulting
the intelligence
at every
there isn't
isn't anything
after minutes
minutes it
it ends
an excuse for
don't need to
to have seen
have seen the
focus of the
to be on
tend to be
kind of like
them but the
but the fact
with lots of
the only reason
attempts at humor
special effects the
the bad acting
so that it
that it can
them and the
and the screen
as the others
at least one
least one of
of the crew
one is the
the crew is
is now a
the first movie
scene and the
scenes in the
and the way
the way they
they do in
do in the
but the best
the best scene
best scene in
the first to
are forced to
might be the
is in this
it was written
the screenplay by
piece of work
lot of the
the effects are
you can't really
there's very little
very little of
of them and
some very funny
at the top
top of his
i have to
to get off
the makers of
makers of this
reprises his role
is good but
good but not
the film of
variation on the
pulls it off
get an oscar
and the first
an oscar nomination
behind the camera
film which doesn't
is much more
is it just
the third installment
the best part
best part of
at every turn
it's not that
away from a
film there is
the state
state of
about ten
ten years
the alien series
years back
back with
the unexpected
success of
mad max
max and
to begin
a sequence
sequence that
that includes
a green

a rare
visual flair
final battle
camp and
which would
lost a
my interest
was much
intrigued by
following the
of human
acts as
was about
my personal favorite
ground for
just seemed
seemed a
the post
made on a
who just
just got
my nerves
and didn't
didn't really
really care
the battle
alter ego

what appears
and her daughter
something a
no but
lead character
character his
demeanor and
scene has
the song
with either
either one
in quite
played by the
love interests
didn't seem
songs are
give a
a distance
ass about
given a chance
about anyone
anyone but
chance to be
a finger
finger on
to represent
that all
coming to
quick and
now i'm
ending and
sure if
the fault
fault of
a silver
visually the
not be a
wings and
surprise ending
none too
planet of
the scene is
finale in
film back
film this
tacked on
years from now
much about
despite being
sense to
unless you
films which
you look
at it
it from
over substance
a statement
overall i
many critics
the planet
part the
which they
story but
rather the
this world
appreciate the
world by
by using
using his
character development
are able to
cinematography and
able to keep
why was
and especially
music to
play as
as characters
his film
male and
is especially
the soundtrack
were just
soundtrack which
wall to
to wall
music as
for anyone
original i
i cannot
as a young
cannot believe
they didn't
and occasionally
the lead
this case
music by
mark wahlberg
that sounds
which he's
impressive but
is the way
a mad
way to the
type of
thing the
extremely good
be put
put off
off by
surrounded by
plot there is
who can
the arrival
battlefield earth
and michael
and tragic
have their
trying to get
to get her
his way to
into their
their respective
respective roles
is at
thing in the
construction of
merely a
a metaphor
oh yeah and
there to be
to be funny
resorting to
be funny the
looking like a
and found
the mid
tim burton movie
a party
a human being
a person
than just
most of this
an especially
the thing that
an extremely
i mean i
put out
out by
help us
communicate with
one of these
would still be
have to give
give it up
it up to
has left
to all of
film work
of eye
eye candy
the prime
in the morning
movie they
look the
so on and
on and so
influenced by
dances with wolves
but this movie
without the
the personal
characters on the
the screen as
because he's
as well i
the most developed
is merely
only a few
although it
then comes
comes back
every scene in
scene in which
of really
material that
the film the
movie could have
could really
could have given
really be
better the
is fantastic
ending is
the fight scenes
final half
out into the
only does
it not
bring the
and the final
to any
stop at
did anyone
was much more
mystery is
characters and the
a script that
it almost
like there
was no
no point
than to
still it
does what
a bit too
the doors
kind of film
of a small
you have to
visual style
to go see
style to
go see it
on my nerves
see it on
for the way
the way that
to those
half assed
suppose the
this season
message is
life but
something a little
but after
what else
needs more
lo and
and behold
the really
the heels
heels of
during its
kiss the
the girls
girls and
you did
it must
did last
have felt
last summer
felt like
either one of
that era
the added
the material
knowing the
didn't seem to
and tired
to give a
energy to
make any
the proceedings
what happened to
i'm not sure
not sure if
young child
if this was
game that
belongs to
but the film
dennis quaid
because of it
nice to look
for quite
removed from
the result of
case but
of interest
keep him
most recent
planet of the
of the apes
takes him
that he was
local sheriff
r lee
lee ermey
is torn
torn between
between his
all that much
his new
you look at
look at it
danny glover
feel of the
of the planet
in which they
saves the
less and less
jared leto
one as
like everyone else
and that's why
that's why the
holding a
a piece
soon as it
movie and the
and the fact
but i would
pretending to
the cold
he knows
be a part
a part of
the basic
for its
its first
movie presents
for anyone who
evidence that
has seen the
these three
three men
the original i
believe that they
the film a
we're given
bring back the
given little
insight into
the scene in
who they
in the 80s
are likely
fear that
character in this
in this case
is asked to
much too
fast and
go back and
find out what
the world in
the proper
world in which
killer's identity
the pacing
pacing and
generation of
not only to
of suspense
put off by
off by the
fact that he's
to the entire
probably because
to build
coming from the
their true
the set up
and the story
story is a
is a result
stop it
tendency to
is solid
solid in
be very
a supporting
supporting role
that's more
interesting than
thrown together
together but
claire danes
object of
of affection
would definitely
tried and
and true
not likely
also pretty
pretty decent
time director
who wrote
in seeing
and die
found in a
word of
in a bar
of mouth
doesn't know
do he
knows what
didn't make
this is no
wants it
was pleasantly
provides some
pleasantly surprised
visuals the
to be it
wasn't bad
bad at
looks good
good even
it's pretty
run of
the mill
the beautiful
not something
something i
say is
watch in
in case
case you
turn a
a diamond
in it's
a form of
pierce brosnan
to study
the volcano
perhaps more
is determined
lo and behold
near future
the lack
of more
more substantial
the heels of
they finally
kiss the girls
and i know
i know what
know what you
what you did
you did last
good guy
did last summer
will of
day or
the mayor
mayor of
will become
infatuated with
plot development
you haven't
to make any
many movies
any of the
movies there's
of the proceedings
kids and
to tug
tug at
combined with the
at your
murder of a
not only a
the world the
the way it
way it was
if there
you that
it were a
merely because
a waste
across the country
for quite a
quite a while
and decide
for yourself
while he is
it succeeds
succeeds at
at what
what it's
to speak of
have a tendency
a tendency to
to be very
to see a
the local sheriff
r lee ermey
and at times
to it as
word of mouth
i was pleasantly
was pleasantly surprised
to find that
run of the
of the mill
but it's not
a piece of
piece of the
to watch in
in case you
you don't know
that the two
turn out to
the villain in
pretending to be
have been one
so much about
in the very
any of these
could be the
the lack of
who they are
and when they
of the town
able to make
the moment when
save the day
the killer's identity
he finds a
with one another
if you think
away from home
of the acting
to be part
be part of
you haven't seen
there's also the
that are the
his way through
way through the
or the other
such as a
i don't want
in a supporting
a supporting role
if there was
there was a
more interesting than
interesting than the
and the film's
the film's most
a waste of
meant to be
in brief
film since
of modern
american pop
pop culture
prepared for
by watching
a moving
teacher who
death of
may be the
came off
a dumb
new movie
might just
going to the
her latest
and given
a point
it wouldn't
wouldn't be
what appears to
be a real
movie version
an event
the absolute
a choice
scene has a
dialogue as
as what
buck henry
written for
and smart
match for
the cinematic
a town
town called
concerns the
stone and
how she
life is a
the obstacles
life long
tried and true
being on
on tv
course one
first time director
who wrote the
doesn't know what
he knows what
what he wants

overcome the
to look like
look like the
like the movie
really been
actress but
shows a
the action is
for comedy
this picture
and the beautiful
her portrayal
the incredibly
shallow and
femme fatale
in all of
a star
she sees
and it seems
not enough to
all this is
from hell
to turn a
and more than
her future
husband and
and sister
sister in

know she
it comes off
off as a
or whatever

i only
wish that
politics and
about the way
way it is
very close
of those films
is delivered

worst movie
to think that
it's basically
and doesn't
doesn't stop
allow me
to state
few more
material and
his audience
it without
all american
great and
and includes
includes some
to move
i've heard
move the
it's utterly
a blast
against the
see through
and uninteresting
media and
sits there
there on
big and
and ugly
on just
few characters
laugh or
find something
something in
to avoid
is amusing
story by
hank azaria

crisp and
offended by
exaggeration of
danny elfman

but everyone
and mature
the cheap
seen as a
leave the
just as a
a ball
dog that
fifteen minutes of
the location
could go
american pop culture
on but
i do
for this film
actors in
actually did
from time
character and his
to time
the leads
the premise
the death of
film before
of her husband
the finished
finished product

a dud
the talk
a fat
fat suit
her in the
in the new
their characters are
the new film
characters are not
have lost
are not really
like and
it basically
basically just
thought that the
looked like
think i'm
again after
since this is
is a major
part in the
my best
best friend's
notting hill
pretty woman
it wouldn't be
be the first
of the last
story of how
have seen this
seen this movie
of the real
i would definitely
turn into a
into a movie
for this movie
is beyond me
in a town
good but it
around in the
it is merely
character who is
is not one
her and her
of course one
in his own
with a little
be much better
funny enough to
and the ending
the ending is
to overcome the
i just don't
the worst movie
just not funny
her portrayal of
and for the
for the record
allow me to
a few more
of its characters
a plot and
and it just
there on the
for you to
if he had
this is very
romantic comedy with
this movie on
to see what
what went wrong
though she is
goes on the
that he's going
going to kill
to leave the
leave the theater
being in the
not only does
i could go
only does it
could go on
and he makes
the story to
makes us believe
us believe that
the actors in
actors in this

characters as they
they attempt to

isn't going to
i don't remember
because i had
change of heart
hour or
or so
to turn the
the jackal
as people
at in

a spoof of
i hope
the fate of
gets killed
the soap opera
lies in the

really like
sole reason
reason you
a suspense
suspense film
he's being
as much a
the events in
every year
year a
action packed
but the real
big name
is because it
willis and
the hopes
that some
within the confines
forget the
the confines of
several years
its ability to
war and the
clooney and
and kidman
an almost
all of it
on the road
the road to

use of the

that's what makes
what makes it
of the key

on the contrary
he's out

is the epitome
the epitome of

as one of

sure the
it becomes a
other scene
too short
short and
and too
comedy from
to register
writer of
four weddings
weddings and
a funeral
of them to
even an
entertaining one

it is about
it can't

the themes

he turns out
really need to
in time to
to visit
allows us
learn more
is almost as
before from
number on
cheap and
team up to
things which
have nothing to
nothing to do
to do the
plot is a
like it was
but despite
death the
on the floor
the floor and
her because
that's when
when our
closer to the
comes out
to the truth
she wasn't
is not even
the plot and
plot and the
she really
really was
is difficult
the feeling that
he's in a
no real
to shock and
probably could
that the filmmakers
never met
serves as
so many times
many times before
can't help
us from
but the point
he's done
x files is
is not what
the wall
the person who
it has been
is we
if this were
the whole film
i did like
like this movie
well enough to
the pacing of
pacing of the
golden globe
movie starts
the audience can
too busy
concentrating on
act but
eventually gets
gets it
of say
not have been
late 70s
is brilliant
be better
in north america
sounds like
in several
his character as
she should
is very good
and a couple
that kind of
her but
to make something
not up
a sequence where
almost like
when the movie
a guilty
guilty pleasure
movie is set
is set in
thinks he
and a bit
a lovable
there is an
nothing compared
has its share
its share of
and jonathan
but none of
a poker
it soon
into the world
and becomes
the world of
to convey the
released in
woody allen's
everyone says
says i
you it's
who directed the
the hollywood
have yet to
be dead
dead but
made a film
can come
the movie there
one that is
and pretty much
the characters or
characters or the
escape from the
in one of
to release a
of the scene
first big
makes it so
an nc
nc rating
violence but
of hollywood's
the folks
and together they
they have some
to american

a hint of

not surprisingly
there might be
more interested in
they are in
the stock

stock characters
not even the
the tv show
out there's
to come along
will not
like in
what dreams
dreams may
may come
come the
will come
but little
little do
a complex
theater i
the audience's
film ended
believe the
quite possibly
kids will
bored with
us it
goes back
and forth
forth in
city of
of angels
screenplay and
both films
i doubt
do well
well at
club owner
owner of
development or
a coherent
storyline is
window dressing
money back
back but
film's main
an endless
story i
doubt it
everyone who
who thought
story was
was too
james cameron
written a
well but
of direction
but don't
me wrong
wrong i
hope the
make matters
matters worse
does do
a vision
to sit
sit through
put to
screen i
have thought
in our
own mind
for trying
second best
you want
and watch
dark city
that because
up going
begins with
williams is
at a time
the sudden
the beauty
beauty of
bond and
get married
an artist
attack on a
and loves
than life
but one
and the film
children are
are killed
car crash
to be just
be just as
commit suicide
its subject matter
but fails
is then
director paul verhoeven
anymore and
nothing will
will change
gets her
a young woman
a name for
his version
gooding jr
to begin with
is without
prior to
he would
what will
will happen
for the film's
the film's main
is crucial
crucial to
it away
they tell
he dies
dies in
not necessarily
to make matters
make matters worse
it deals
to sit through
sit through the
of god
there but
and some of
in film history
search for
love of
movies is
depicted as
for trying to
trying to break
among the
the clouds
and watch the
goes a
a concept
us have
jean claude
claude van
van damme
first ten
ten minutes
life his
movie now
now if
real and
to finally
a van
different way
start a
depictions of
of hell
we find
the normal
the newly
stereotypes of
of fire
a state
the russian
russian mafia
a sea
sea of
damme is
their bodies
in france
who finds
are made
knew about
if to
the mood
truly a
the french
production designer
avenge his
his death
once there
the art
there he
computer technology
hooks up
are created
some scenes
play out
set out
are only
necessary to
be there
but we
who also
appears in
missed the
his acting
some interesting
whose work
work was
a difficult
job as
as most
high point
effects but
thought she
she would
does a
a masterful
by richard
moves on
viewers to
simply put
absolutely nothing
all together
his final
good example
which may
may just
off a
portion of
still can't
average movie
movie goer
than likely
attention from
people but
shouldn't take
too far
every movie
all just
ever been
been involved
his dramatic
while his
jean claude van
claude van damme
within the first
makes up
the first ten
first ten minutes
ten minutes of
stuff but
minutes of the
the movie now
a screenplay
he isn't
isn't quite
isn't enough to
as effective
enough to get
to get you
drama is
his strong
movie i don't
know what is
it is certainly
mind if
to start a
a movie of
year with
this may
we find out
find out that
out that the
some much
much needed
also quite
quite possible
possible that
doesn't like
the russian mafia
rise and fall
in his last
and josh
van damme is
a treat
movie goers
out that he
that he had
recognize him
back from the
he had a
from the dead
lost in
not hard
gets killed in
he thinks
audiences are
goes to the
williams and
find out who
film what
her way to
thematic elements
disturbing images
hooks up with
up with his
set out to
real problem
among other things
deals with the
up to the
slows down
to the usual
just after
after we
this movie in
and before
just in case
begins by
way some
mistaken for
a sexual
and she does
you should
in actuality
just thought
let you
many people will
to like in
what dreams may
dreams may come
will come to
out that this
story to tell
of the theater
the theater i
i could see
there is absolutely
had to be
this movie it
after the film
plays like a
this is definitely
is definitely not
definitely not a
this is quite
just like the
even if they
if they do
to come out
in recent years
has ever been
after all this
back and forth
people involved
it has no
their most
recent films
john frankenheimer
city of angels
this is why
who made
is why the
drama the
the manchurian
manchurian candidate
way back
kind of a
and a more
early s
critics and
but i doubt
the opening moments
left in
his directorial
car chase
chase scenes

boiler room
i doubt it
charlize theron
decent job
cider house
house rules
when all
as we see
movie will
have great
over by the
as well but
don't get me
get me wrong
me wrong i
coming out
was my
a vision of
at two
two in
it for the
these actors
seemed like
everyone was
not given
a fair
her in a
all seen
a while it
most of us
however the film
together in a
movie were
fun and
complete opposite
to want
doesn't look
from this point
evidence of
is horrible
horrible and
when there

that is until

this character is
times the
most irritating
because he has
decides to leave
he has no

has no real
a christmas
what will happen
the number
but the two
reason the
to the rest
serves as a
give it away
to the plot
machine is
is getting
tell you that
especially when
dead the
only saving
saving grace
movie from
stars is
it deals with
movie for
for such
a pointless
people had
and there but
there but the
but the story
than just a
search for the
the love of
for a reason
the cast and
is almost always
the people involved
looks like it
such as the
scene where she
it shows us
the manchurian candidate
have never seen
never seen before
the early s
the movie starts
there for the
the film at
he wrote the
wrote the script
a state of
a decent job

the movie will
potential to be
coming out of
for an oscar
she should be
state of the
of the art
the movie could
as if they
if they are
to be there
not up to
acting is so
almost like a
a guilty pleasure
it seemed like
seen in the
the script and
nothing compared to
to the original
special effects but
does have a
on the set
a computer generated
and he does
he does a
in a number
from the novel
with his friends
to put on
at a bar
put on a
that the audience
the complete opposite
it really is
want to be
it all together
and becomes a
a good example
good example of
doesn't look like

no time
nothing less than
the genre
into the future
films this
on a planet
only as
most interesting
film probably
star wars
is stuck in
written all
stuck in a
than the original
the producers
of showing
off their
battle scenes
tension and
since we
the setting
setting is
is it's
it's impossible
about anything
would be like
that happens
happens in
in essence
in to the
of filmmaking
we meet
family of
of five
but has
then there are
there are the
does have its
a little girl
is beginning to
each member
get rid of
especially in the
rid of the
family has
the treatment of
personality and
them seem
roles in the
hurt is
of place in
place in the
you don't have
don't have to
something out of
this aspect
will play
too much and
course this
this movie with
film there are
the original movie
all of this
other while
problems are
make the movie
fact it's
trace of
of satire
satire and
first act
act is
a building
a story
no purpose
familiar with the
and characterization
god forbid
it's a little
film from
fact it
is to have
might as
well be
is virtually
characters do
which would be
would be the
to visit his
the conflict
for all its
them all to
plot devices
eventually the
its title
title as
to defeat
villain and
his plans
only wants to
what ensues
ensues is
to lead the
scene takes
place on
an abandoned
find a way
be described
described as
everyone else is
planet and
and must
who wants to
there's never
everyone in the
notion of
suspense here
here because
as if he
a great film
but each
however is the
helena bonham carter
the king of
the atmosphere
time travel
and various
is a smart
michael clarke duncan
building the
is a really
a really good
film production
so poorly
written directed
directed and
and acted
of the humans
at p m
p m at
m at the
life this is
a feel good
the words of
the big budget
too much about
the success of
movie of all
who created the
have to admit
is the movie
though it is
his work on
lost in space
is the latest
comes at the
a film so
at the very
the very end
it a little
from the original
made up of
that should be
of science fiction
a summer movie
an amusement park
and a few
a few laughs
as is the
lived up to
urban legend
all it is
last few
few films
genre has
has produced
only as the
as the most
the most interesting
of i
behavior and
because it has
the disappointing
written all over
all over it
in store
store for
but as the
entertaining but
rehash of
and how much
battle scenes are
a hip
entertainment but
become one
the setting is
it's impossible to
to care about
identity is
imagine what
piece of filmmaking
we meet the
you guessed
a family of
screen we
does not get
only person
you didn't
men and
and women
women as
break any
any new
new ground
a mix
mix and
entertainment it
each member of
of the family
coming on
i've had
a witty
film s
really sure
sure what
might not
guess it
seem so
the pattern
so much time
story goes
the on
on target
direction by
of course this
taken on
road trip
i need
people up
more frightening
so different
frightening than
at the right
is the fact
a journey
journey to
driving down
meet his
a deserted
a gas
and is so
the first act
gas station
one problem
of a story
brad dourif
the direction
her into
the monkey
the dreaded
the credit
credit card
a drug
a phone
the film from
but really
film from being
really the
in fact it
might as well
as well be
on plot
off and
the dialogue is
expect it
or on
the creepy
but they do
just trying
oral sex
they do not
relate to the
never seems
run out
just there
but are
are great
said in
in character
back seat
seat of
after an hour
an hour of
the car
so who
the slightly
it's understandable
off kilter
you find
find this
the college
is excellent
throughout and
and rather
a class
urban legends
acting with
the sometimes
up to its
his resume
a woody
the chief
mention the
the hand
to guess
be of
scenes like
what ensues is
one you
is a series
politics of
scene takes place
takes place on
and everybody
be described as
a la
fill in
the blank
to knock
them down
the conventional
because the script
structure is
family in
flirting with
embark on
to seek
but find
into more
learn to
is anything
is no sense
no sense of
must give
is due
and the family
not many
many other
this film there's
courtesy of
come to a
the last few
men and women
characters in a
that a film
i was in
in store for
rehash of the
on in a
realizing that
of potential
potential and
it's not just
could've been
such is
up of the
idea behind
the mad
become one of
the best films
the story goes
include the
starts out as
with the plot
out as a
the plot a
from inside
so you
can't see
the face
of style
so different from
different from the
you guessed it
premise is
idea of the
the only person
off from
movie takes
man who was
a peaceful
new england
as a child
like most
slasher flicks
one also
young female
to meet his
with his wife
believe it or
killed off
not one of
a knife
not really sure
but if you
just go
go after
the dialogue and
dialogue and the
the direction by
degenerates into
performances by the
but was
passes for
though it was
at about
the point is
i need to
the slasher
to tell you
point is that
victim is
always be
be used
more frightening than
begins with a

other hand it
it was not
to me at
me at least
their roles
clearly the
events that
film based
told me
of british
thurman is
also happens
lot about
of the english
up while
due to its
mother is
is played
his co
like this but
father is
the equally
the weather
the film an
a crazy
our heroes
had better
stop him
him or
or else
else the
will keep
the strongest
hell to
up one
film's few
especially for
few funny
in cinema
with english subtitles
that go
characters it
make no
sense for
heroes are
has been so
swarm of
and son
attached to
demonstrates the
really go
the basic plot
worst of
the bugs
is a young
sent to the
roberto benigni
here for
the sixth
never even
in s
bad but
like so
better when
many scenes
keep your
your attention
is already
you it
her off
her feet
feet and
i realized
love with her
do any
any good
two have
has clearly
off on a
times that
unfortunately for
family the
happens there
that didn't
final cut
takes this
low budget
of family
him to his
particularly bad
that don't
to our
is a story
aren't the
his son's
because this
the realm of
the sweet
and i use
he constantly
son that
here one
well rounded
certainly one
until this
strong as
its script
beautiful is
a self
self proclaimed
which tells
beauty and
it manages
here i
to sink
don't blame
a saturday
subplot involving
to a few
be easy
half the
fine form
form and
of focus
interest for
one dimensional and
matter who
the plot's
the screenwriter
of foreign
foreign film
will see
this is something
a memorable
aided by a
movie had
had it
see their
their first
it been
movie by
right is
actors for
above all
of destruction
which this
been given
the task
one was
but here
it mostly
feel as if
and humor
of experience
experience in
in big
budget action
choice for
for director
this side
of james
the sets
life is beautiful
and often
set piece
in the best
of times and
the worst of
music score
stuff is
i first saw
in his career
more that
that needs
inspiration for
maybe a
the one i
listen to the
all though
liked to
see these
for not
giving them
the music in
it's a testament
film can be
a testament to
can be easily
testament to the
by the presence
it is as
it is with
after the movie
in it is
is a joy
prior to this
that it had
he has done
film ever made
without a doubt
that it was
of the genre
is truly a
not know
james wong
certainly one of
was directed by
final destination
who brought us
create the
the remake of
but the movie
the similarities
of these things
plot to
a self proclaimed
the mysterious
it manages to
mulder and
if it weren't
and scully
it weren't for
to the level
weren't for the
a saturday night
stuff like
and the performances
more important
main problem with
time this
a teen
teen horror
none of it
movie especially
the trash
legend and
will see this
still know
this as a
destination is
its unique
horror flick
some of its
this is just
is just plain
the grim
this being
of the popular
will die
brief history
will not be
given in
to learn that
at others
i don't even
is unique
about death
that i don't
i don't have
is a fine
i didn't know
know and love
of teenagers
surprising to
i was not
will take
take his
a trip
trip to
to paris
mind the
his dreams
and six
kicked off
so perfect
with the series
perfect in
right before
a shock
shortly after
film based on
max a
what the film
through with
one by
is some kind
sees his
being thrown
is just a
out he
allows for
in even
who also happens
hot water
also happens to
he falls
scenes i
falls for
a lot about
while some
enlists the
of tension
others are
they will
to work together
wide open
creativity and
is played by
most horror
not like
plans to
annoying but
yet seen
plays him
the finest
movie too
someone of
as everyone
its just
just another
else has
has probably
that won't
is reminiscent
academy awards
they have to
was reminded
to go to
of paul
myriad of
a visual
the film's few
is named
who died
died in
haven't yet
seen from
him while
our heroes are
best performance
time making
groundhog day
time watching
given much
even if i
do except
react to
fine work
theme of the
it isn't
perfect film
must see
see for
coming of
of age
works well
without an
a modern
think that the
mulder and scully
like so many
the film it
in mind the
a much more
about the story
in the role
is that both
that even the
is more interested
are several scenes
the final cut
to some of
released in the
which makes it
couple of years
urban legend and
on the brink
the last scene
i still know
still know what
the scenes that
he falls for
final destination is
the action scenes
because this is
enlists the help
is an action
an action film
for everyone involved
according to the
i love the
he wants to
to understand the
as we are
of the finest
as everyone else
i don't blame
for there is
is a strange
is reminiscent of
reminiscent of a
i was reminded
it can't be
out of it
on a trip
a trip to
his best performance
i can see
kicked off the
isn't given much
that could have
much to do
been a good
to do except
just a little
it isn't a
a perfect film
on which this
must see for
which this film
anyone who wants
to see that
one by one
coming of age
that this one
this one was
have seen in
to be but
no i
not read
you have the
see i
this side of
research on
the set design
with bad
bad luck
throughout his
can imagine
it makes a
from start
start to
from the beginning
beginning to the

this stuff is
19th century

sincere and
those of us
and solid
solid as
of us who
is missing
but she has
she has no
a likeable
it seems like
the actress
we're not
it's often
understand why
beyond a
the final product
know what's
but oh
is nice
and sophisticated
of role
on this one
sentimental and
an eerie
helps to
was a good
in star
wars episode

that pop
pop up
phantom menace
up more
they look

detail of
is undeniably
this one it's
without being
and frankly
frankly it's
walk the
next to nothing
nothing in this
perhaps that
another movie
has in
common with
with it's
and people
atmosphere and
appeared to be
be the last
the last minute
scary or
scare the
the youngest
michael j

and brings
more out
the first five
see him in
five or six
him in a
fits the
perfectly and
gem of
nathan lane
the idea that
a comedian

those characters
characters we
we love
to dislike
who never
never gives

i really do
it was about
more as a
this film does

a time to
time to kill
is as good
hard to understand
to be with
with a few
and i loved
kind of role
gets to play
that pop up
another problem is
no pun intended
but this one
with the story
is not going
one that i
a little boy

acting from
from everyone
fun at the

a particular
million dollar budget
the captain

upon my
the action sequences
great actor
it happens

released and
much money
money as
those other
catch up
have taken
taken the

goal is to
is to take
and mostly
world that is
and these
becomes involved
an ambitious
pursuit of
their human

plot itself
as a way
a way to
sole purpose

an extended
part was
which a

a deadly
sequences in
must say
is about as
thanks for
spectacular as
i sure
couldn't figure
figure it
to become the
rumble in
shot from

and done
basically the
nor is
action scene
scene after
and finds himself
himself in a
anything as
first strike
the energy
out before

my god
a letdown
for fans
no interesting
interesting characters
almost entirely
in english
voices of

hints at
to hollywood
on the run
with s
more on the
next in
a wonder
wonder that
we already
that big
will continue
too many times
they find themselves
the chemistry between
because of this
of sight
sight and
of it the
is a highly
the two are
in them
the run from

it is quite
they knew

a veteran
contempt for

this bad
bad in
grounded in
what were
were you

worked for
the plot itself
plot itself is
lends itself
itself to
the comic book
the sole purpose
sole purpose of
jamie lee curtis
down for
say that it's
is yet another
examination of
group of people
present and
this also
also plays
plays on
only to find
cast but
is out to
but most
most importantly
way back to
and effective
voice over
has several
several characters
to come in
a greater
in which a
perspective of
the issues
are many
told from
a top
for years and
i'm beginning to
none of the
the struggle
struggle of
action sequences in
rumble in the
a director who
make a movie
for american
make a film
is just another
win the
and want
an excellent
the film seems
commanding officer
an aging
soldier who
embodies the
movie from the
for fans of
about a group
of captain
even so the
the voices of
each and
has a similar
sean penn
three hours
hours long
the interest
film will be
will be a
is high
because of a
the climax
forty five
goes without
without saying
does this film
drags on
be compared
to s
masterpiece of
they have been
but it also
also fails to
films for
days to
cast of characters
never see
this can
of the major
produce a
a phony
war against
has written a
the blue
of hollywood
hollywood and
the effects of
with woody
harrelson as
hero and
there wasn't
this it
second rate
are not only
great actors
actors like
and it's not
speak and
it's based
ok maybe
maybe it's
don't give a
give a damn
don't even have
the acting from
in the lead
two things
things this
of the roles
is invited
to spend
movie actually
being made
the house
will go down
plays on the
the performance of
of which he
of the fall
hard rain
to the movie
the movie a
that no one
perspective of the
to locate
the map
it can be
opposed to a
or from
make this film
the struggle of
production design and
and it may
of course i
or anyone else
the white
primary colors
yes i
am a
disappointed in
so much for
david mamet's
to win the
this by
us in
a fantasy
fantasy world
so that we
all what
what do
have to sit
brings me
minus the
you but
he's doing
action scenes are
very nice
difficult to follow
performance which
each and every
fits in
of the men
the scene where
air of
scene where a
of the ship
lives for
the film can
he's so
of them is
of disaster
i must say
sunglasses and
note that
figure it out
when i saw
the aliens in
a show
a producer
it was all
part and
forty five minutes
minutes before the
before the end
the movie it
it goes without
drawn and
goes without saying
it off with
without saying that
we want
saves the day
the day and
and at least
least a couple
couple of the
talk in
be compared to
know them
a political
number of times
of action and
cool and
to do so
it's a wonder
we already know
denis leary
favorite actors
out of sight
a story to
tie ins
this can be
can be a
be a very
his money
an energetic

in history
handle the
millions of dollars
mystery and
song to
the hilarious
he is and
and creative
the green

where people
for making this
needed a
the ever
misery and

his house
house to
hollywood in

the list
list goes
after taking

to enter
don't make
me he

they do it
and the fun
battle but
that funny
for most
fascination with

real characters
although a
one will
star cast
not more
that was a
her past
to spend a
at one of
watching a movie
though her
the money to

to breathe
an assortment of

not much
you remember
after you
you leave

without any of

hollywood movie
what is it
generation that
is it that
that although
a horrible
bad and

we've seen before
could make a
just about the
this the film
that her husband

of the green
part as the
hero of the
time and space
not the way
and a bunch
or not to

you've ever
seen any
the time he
he arrives at
really don't
details the
right from the
to the last
to is
we've all
is the type
the type of
i'm going
time was
with him in
was looking
isn't for

the writers
it would not
would not have
only problem is
is at his
would at
your seat
f x
be wrong

those involved
involved with

pathetic attempts

exactly where
the mask
the film while
why didn't
i'll tell
ving rhames
and though
things about the
film may be
even he
rescue this
the depths
do not know
describe this

behind a

character of the

in the characters
have been nice
to himself
he do

this but i
that if you
script written by

boy who
as with the
be nothing
the entirety of
20th century fox
it is also
of my time
it took me
best movies
wrong with this
to point out
a flight attendant
that one of
of the reasons
its target
and not very
in the climax
the climax and
catherine zeta jones
usual suspects
you end
if you've ever
they should be
should be the
was extremely
sneak preview
in toronto
out so
which the film
went in
the end there
end there is
movie before
before you
it don't
don't let
there was something
let them
and you'll
to be said
be said about
we've all seen
watching the film
film with the
times before and
this film doesn't
in the big
first half of
that the entire
i'm going to
to carry the
to be made
and so is
so is the
the movie even
the sixth sense
while this may
he doesn't have
doesn't have the
is a fascinating
example of how
deep end
violence that
couldn't help
year old boy
material the
in los
party in
in las
be is
this would be
be nothing more
jon favreau
than a movie
think they are
they are just
cameron diaz

my chair
hard that
the scene of
my mind as
the directing
film i had
through a series
bad about
let's just say
as dumb
you cannot
its a
the suit
either for
murder and
rating but
to as the
a friendly
murder scene
just sit
playing with
glad that
running time minutes
a fact
but it's a
a very very
it has all
an upcoming
is up to
of jennifer
and watching
this at
scare in
hear about
goes on a
to be like
just fine
with the most
the end and
care that
a woman with
however even
fiction the
woman who has
animated version
the impression
knew i
female characters
the passing
the 1980s
has gone
friends as
he puts
off for
never happened
the differences
see on
being john malkovich
movie itself
itself it
compared with
a fact that
to be good
also features
character by
to burst
no apparent
apparent reason
a good natured
that we don't
to change his
writers and
it isn't funny
this is my
become a cult
reason the film
a top notch
of it as
why the film
but even if
to be much
film is good
you to see
those people who
just sit back
and enjoy the
a common
big money
money at
office but
and audiences
nothing but a
a story about
a surprising
there it
certainly is
life a
husband a
always wanted
wakes up
enough about the
talk about the
coast guard
the movie itself
she isn't
was worth
to anyone who
while making
phone call
call to
friend who
must get
you can get
she cannot
after she
for no apparent
no apparent reason
is replaced by
his share
breaks into
kid and
which can
can say about
happens the
subtlety and
was great
full circle
for release
is original
yes it
boring at
multiple times
of t
script with
the a
great acting
character while
better movie

and besides
best movies of

who ever
her and she
of suspense and
that he isn't
her lack

to suspect
who has had
his share of
movie turns
the detective
a better movie
can't have
i found the
to recognize
a performance that
is suitably
alternates between
a man who's
suspicious and
to happen in
going to make
anyone ever
questions the
a laughable
almost entirely on
concerned with the
the film were
didn't like the
like the film
making the movie
really all that
all that bad

of those who
for the main
the year the
story takes place
jason mewes and
mewes and kevin
and kevin smith
on more than
than one occasion
are a bit
he's trying to
a few things
for instance the
to star in
fact that she
the characters of
her lack of
is not too
make fun of
and of the
stupid enough to
that all of
the film even
since it is
story is told
to the real
in all this
all this movie
is responsible for
to recognize the
is nothing but
stands as

screen time as
much else
either of the
film as well
do anything to
for me the
the documentary
death this
an examination
somewhere along the
along the line

an abortion

that's as
an explanation
being as

reminiscent of the
everything she
fails miserably
is shot
with a series
it's easier to

lucky enough to

to me the
as though the
gives the best
the enterprise
series to

the ninth
qualifies as
somewhere between
awful movie
what i was
the last ten
so a
a comparison
be some sort
some guy in
leave his
a marvel

thought he was
significance of
many films
and style
was recently

little out
that deserves
scary movie
doesn't bother
our hearts
original the
by anyone
few hundred
this plot
worst thing
don't understand
potential the
a holiday
common sense
sorvino is
is standing
jean luc
luc picard
a moral
best moments
them up
to leave his
cast who
alone are
the stupid
becomes very
open and
from star
his country
be noted
murphy is
movies in
past but
american audience
effects were
thousand times
americans and
that bad but
a little out
little out of
in no
confrontation between

only seen
a film which
is at once
reason i
a few hundred
the viewing
crew of the

guidance counselor
the worst thing
to defend
might want
place that
on and off
star trek insurrection
focus on the
the star trek
to compensate
compensate for
end all
ask yourself
really necessary
film's best
movies in the
the past but
and pulls
a thousand times
to greater
much of this
steve zahn
the significance of

amanda peet
the actors and
fun to be

her mother and

monster that
academy award for

and black
good comedy
example of this
to compensate for
is placed in
special effects were
film but they
in a relationship
in the trailer
the film's best
about to take
thinking about it
it this is
heads and
to the task
but isn't
thing is that
fox and
elizabeth shue
will cause
to repeat
essentially the
even manages
even bother
with everything

my suggestion
one bad
note in

is great and
minute film
theme is
and seemingly
when the director

proud to
the catholic church
funny guy
stars a
felt by

an emergency
getting back
choice but
it not only
executive produced
eventually becomes
is thrown
a lesser
in context
is you

over whether
course it
sex the
old he
age to
figured out
too and
the summer movie
banderas and
wasted here
maybe in
way he's
back at the
it makes for
and he doesn't
regardless of what
of course it
a side note
the characters just
adds another
bloody and

its the
of stuff
mother of
over time

impressive the
real problems
whenever a
being so
not everyone
it says

its genre

culture and
moving from

to control
has a huge
of screen time
they open
in this role

cross dresser
the san
she calls
the mother of
of the performers
film could be
so big
film in its
of violence in
did these
an insult
free using
using my
pass theater
their kids
kids to
see it's
more annoying
mood that
introducing us
the underworld
underworld of
completely and
clothes and
narration is
as if she
is all about
truly the
excellent job
in establishing
as quickly as
and is the
wants us to
a little about
unlike many

are back
but both
thinking the
the cards
rob lowe
they pay
but other
times they
to expand
as just
appearance by
perfectly in
as either
right into the
some things
things on
this makes
showing us

with her own
most other
for free using
free using my
pass theater rating
humor that
minutes i
kids to see
in an abandoned
him when he
introducing us to
portrayed in the
more to this
this movie than
wayne and garth
it was an
an insult to
to describe the
it doesn't look
that is more
from the previous
start this
years i
but these are
into the plot
in horror
directed this
it the way
outstanding performance
of vampires
vampires and
title and
as jack
vampire hunter
plans of
have been in
thomas ian
walk in
daniel baldwin
do the same
of vampire
to go the
they kill
believe this
party for
saying it
seriously but
poor man's
the make
and story

him no
with is a
funny with
films you
you enjoy
flick with
to please
please the
up to an
an outstanding performance
walk in the
would end
act this
talking and
buddies and
i'll never
what some
the make up
sidney prescott
prescott neve
wouldn't it
dream to
a crisis
they're the
that s
the somewhat
want and
location of
times better
could do
and have been
courtney cox
and i am
and events
likely that
taken a
have is
scream has
are most
as himself
finally get to
is slightly
three different
sure which
been very
the distant
which takes
because their
many cases
be because
pop in
that they don't
with scream
more subtle
honestly i
this approach
master of
where to begin
noted that
more seriously
so i'll
this otherwise
my friends
or rather
first viewing
a jackie
revolve around
fall victim
win his
go but
his pregnant
ahead and
had to do
but ends
to know how
action to
chan is
this movie that
using it
no need to
what they want
of someone
seem rather
a movie a
would have you
have you believe
sidney prescott neve
on paper
prescott neve campbell
grown up and
in themselves
has going
you count
count the
where the movie
the highway
movie starts off
situation with
is pregnant
and best
home to his
the location of
barry pepper
than all
those old
alien race
that at
the picture the
so full
still in
full potential
of the lead
the lead characters
such movies
anyway if
has taken a
has it that
so it seems
seems that the
to read the
the church
a clue
and see it
bright spot
the set of
in many cases
lines of the
matter what i
a master of
master of the
of my friends
so full of
of the opening
supposed to believe
a jackie chan
fall victim to
victim to the
worst of the
across the screen
gets stuck
but ends up
to grab
a spunky
list of the
of the problems
the problems with
and his mother
film that does
have something to
and break
break out
give us a
there's plenty of
jackie chan is
film at least
great idea
tim allen
doesn't sound
just say that
refuge in
wayne knight
but that's what
has going for
trouble for
that nobody
have what
film needs
entertaining enough
he's about
can be found
a gangster
nothing much
some decent
over there
allen is
tiresome and
a notch
we will
that at least
i have the
potential in
but sadly
a great idea
he's about to
what makes this
village in
the vehicle
they soon
robin hood
to roll
and even some
a bullet
so much to
smarter than
film seem
gets a little
a light hearted
in no way
reason it is
has had a
into the ground
best thing about
meaning of the
if you look
be remembered as
comic actor
lauren holly
reaches the
there that
a sad
film begins to
it seemed to
where everyone
covers the
becomes more and
this idea
the audience will
idea is
trying to stay
you be
the film seem
too it's
action sequences are
most underrated
screen so
hoping that
that part
right before the
expressions and
night that
up after
foray into
end this
and dumber
dumber and
the down
even the best
brothers who
isn't just a
too much but
you wonder why

in fact this

the movie did
normal people
save the film
do you expect
and a director
been even
was thrown

tell them
don't waste
they really are
was the worst
points in
don't waste your
plays more

the new characters
all been
while there are

there are only
some cases
most teenagers
what are you
the author of

involved the
excellent and
audience really
terminator and
a load of
to spend more
to worry about
picture of a
to kill them
as i mentioned
is the main
of the director
the guilty
the junk
good on
also does a
reasons to
the audience really
he may be
of note is
half is

really going

the worst film
worst film of

directors like
first attempt at
what we have

difficult task

the plot which
touching as
looking as
seeing him
laughs in the

struggling with
and not even
i'm guessing
comes with
slasher movies
one reason

ripped off

shows up as
most of which
sequence in which
too hard on
and silly
her which
title a
her up
here we
unfortunately that
a ludicrous
action set
and let
cinematic history
ride that
at the sight
connection with the
as much of
when that
a manner
throughout the whole
grocery store
for other
film is absolutely
in mary
said of
looked upon
upon as
their predecessors
by tom
hard pressed
is stolen
after hearing
and cast
i do not
such a film
a film it's
more years
years with
in a manner
investigating a
killed a
teenage girl
drug addict
the plotting
the store
voice it
any sort
atmosphere of the
the original's
same story
gets and
question what
be said of
certainly did
hard pressed to
bank robbery
protagonist a
one of its
gun in
albert brooks
a teenage girl
ride in
the same exact
dialogue than
non linear
any sort of
the cast members
jackie brown and
but that's about
the same story
a gun in
so it's not
it is it's
as the next
original but
helped the
of odd
is visually
than their
their father
of a century
than something
he were
masquerading as
on where
be warned
he became
made about
of magic
the atlantic
the manic
good a
little plot
two stars
kids of
to him but
a cohesive
and much of
if he were
hour running
and filled with
plot begins
movie every
the attitude
attitude of
he stole
skin and
the jerry
finally comes
tale about a
hour running time
a movie can
idea but
so all
the characters we
die the
a climactic
generations of
other major
unless of
trouble when
the bathroom
them go
my point
thus begins
should give
an effective
i didn't get
who he is
unless you count
round of
and neil
not be able
the characters as
you wouldn't
made me feel
unless of course
often the
have sex with
sex with her
in the bathroom
story into
a victim of
limited release
into the next
an early scene
follow him
the virus
the differences between
death but
familiar and
people really

to define
one if
within their

seek out
do nothing
our society
wilson who
he's supposed
filmmakers had
jump out
only imagine
leaves us
potential but
and his girlfriend
isn't bad
just might
wondering how
it reminded
he's supposed to
casting is
can only imagine
to seek out
puts on
said before
least some
they're a
to follow up
the filmmakers had
drama in
is charged
audience must
haven't already
it reminded me
lighting and
the ludicrous
cast that
of class
has disappeared
at least some
they get to
her oscar
the casting is
the successful
after watching this
we're shown
but having
to sign
for george
lines from
at me
that is completely
biggest disappointment
disappointment of
show any
jar jar
jar binks
a creature
between this
a galaxy
the movie not
but it sure
more exciting
children the
is smart
and magic
the shots
as to the
example but
and pee
the spiritual

cheech marin
where their
move from
so would
which happens
a blade
invested in
film drags
taste in
more scenes
best things about
plot it
characters well
the jokes that
could find
this movie had
the biggest disappointment
biggest disappointment of
laughing at the
jar jar binks
for the sole
want to watch
you could do
ago in a
of a series
to appeal to
industrial light and
light and magic
they worked
had as
damn good

it is nothing
and that they
walk away
to steve
that you are
off that
they decided to
good scenes
just might be
to recommend the
those are
screen to
filmmakers to
in the darkness
is thrown into
mars is
that a lot
treated to a
the scenes between
one minute
i feel that
the god
is a typical
your best
it's supposed
were a few
of stupidity
it's supposed to
know it is
to retain
and send
and unintentionally
were some
on the one
story if
them to do
there were some
it is based
original scream
slasher movie
cardboard cut
a slick
how their
theater for
laugh in
in countless
murder at
an impact
ludicrous and
i wished
are lots
it coming
for the best
seems to get
laugh in the
the original scream
though some of
gain a
the terrorist
have helped the
rises above
there are lots
are lots of
the arab
americans are
female character
point but
three children
glory and
courage under
under fire

more this
beavis and butthead
thumbs down
from under

it but i
but i didn't
do people
the bit
in peril
can be so
off when
of cool
a bond
in the words
brief scenes
you don't like
money making
revenge for
battle sequences
kills his
see much
only three
as i have
wife and son
but it only
is the daughter
better films
their brains
the battle scenes
are filmed in
soldiers in
things all
can't go
movie theaters
don't tell
appreciate this
hams it
three movies
until then
one thing is
it ever
subject is
a few people
whole is
when they get
are expected
but what the
mary and
chemistry and
what did
to mars is
intricate and
comfort in
know more
action as
them all the
is open
an accomplishment
hams it up
especially during the
where the characters
are expected to
who are all
relates to
an unseen
to know more
know more about
far in
through but
is explained
set up in
there isn't much
times the film
it goes to
goes along with
gina gershon
the team is
we like
the vessel
touch but
burst out
thing we
teamed with
and moody
you not
borders on
b grade
to the u
he was on
length of the
is therefore
exactly what is
and i can
they almost
film instead
out because
shots are
leslie nielsen
time getting
to be over
as he can
film was a
that becomes
full metal
metal jacket
blow up
wish the
full metal jacket
you've got a
he enlists
plot in this
hopefully the
when they do
about twenty minutes
he enlists the
a guy in
but his performance
in the course
them to the
jericho cane
substance and
and visual
here we are
but for a
quit his
the dumbest
has died
you are in
over some
bear to
and you don't
be asking
put some
is obsessed
it will probably
do with it
than this the
is obsessed with
the music and
won an oscar
present the
she'll be
moved by
that not even
some stupid
the front door
done before and
in previous
in five
is these
past is
to sound
hoped that
a great cast
proved to be
success in the
he spends his
section of the
so as to
you haven't already
roland emmerich
i probably
the americans
however if you
this film so
that serves
of red
are neither
guys the
her ex
even care
ride of
roger corman
trailers for
give this film
were killed
to take him
this is only
tale and
own a
anger and
lord of
sarah polley
she puts
dying in
her situation
cast was
accent is
freeze and
would've been
fascinated by the
for me i
lord of the
so much better
them all together
this if you
terrible film
from making
vampires in
and you're
know exactly what
as a serious
some occasional
at least they
yes you
creative and
loads of
will want
to work as
something that is
to fill the
will want to
well when
manner that
not afraid
race and
about getting
present for
film the movie
same time as
sit through this
not afraid to
but i can
in any other
little while
north carolina
jay mohr
element to
a little while
the catch
element to the
slowly but
can trust
hide the
anyone is
slowly but surely
thought the movie
in the apartment
is genuinely
and jeff
bizarre and
the memories
represents the
godzilla has
the truly
is powerful
us from the
heavy metal
me over
have trouble
really wants to
me and i
but not the
film with an
films from
even try to
buffy the
vampire slayer
perhaps this is
showing up
sign on
english patient
his violent
and depressing
opening scene of
talented actor
buffy the vampire
the vampire slayer
is definitely one
if you ask
you ask me
too close to
rich man
as george
of fish
the english patient
while watching this
the effect of
movie can be
more than two
where she is
high quality
had something
reaction was
suffer from
paid to
with it as
still don't
pay to see
to work out
the movie because
of my life
stealing a
all the elements
the elements of
film the acting
the park
presence of a
with tom
has a problem
need to go
use in
of them but
pray that
film except
danger and
is covered
execution the
wants to get
in the hopes
the indiana
her dad
is why i
off he
the indiana jones
the feeling of
self important
alien from
movie again
jerry lewis
understands the
is who
work very well
here we have
when he meets
a quarter
so good at
scarier than
an invisible
maiden voyage
minutes the film
experimenting with
scene for
why someone
episodes that
the angel
whatever and
hopkins is
scene that is
it down to
on what is
a turn for
turn for the
which he must
mainly on
as mrs
a religious
to muster
movie making
a three hour
but nevertheless
the grave
is a drug
why did i
quite impressive
for why
what seems to
this so
in for good
in love the
down i
along with a
a force
team and
the coach
career to
thought was
things we
smaller roles
result of the
whose name
in a seemingly
is required
but in my
been warned
admiration for
kyle maclachlan
cares if
will all
information and
the truck
enjoy this movie
a quarter of
interesting ideas
not in a
movie in fact
an experiment
as if we
an amateur
have also
addition the
a stage play
proving that
project the
wasn't funny
because its
a lie
by contrast
while with
serves up
what looks
in addition the
and strong
exactly one
only work
than to make
the thought of
that some people
comes back to
that's too bad
too bad because
they don't have
don't have any
what looks like
doesn't go anywhere
or otherwise
head is
a mixed
through the entire
the dumb
the drama
ten minute
events are
an overly
unnecessary and
death of his
of tension and
know you're
him if he
we cut
of rocks
over but
it's boring
digital effects
you know you're
may be too
we cut to
words in
the net
drugged out
overlook the
to overlook the
which works
the original but
basketball team
over for
conspiracy theory
for the worse
story had
on a movie
these scenes are
it presents
need the
i was never
editing and
if you see
is not funny
then again maybe
with it the
funny unfortunately
the lethal
to name
to attend
watch her
the lethal weapon
the big question
that your
the audience it
interesting scenes
also shows
broad daylight
performances especially
cast member
considering how
why would you
ever put
in broad daylight
major league
